# **About the Prize**

#### **Who is Lee Kuan Yew?**

Lee Kuan Yew (1923–2015) was the first Prime Minister of Singapore, serving from 1959 to 1990. He has played a crucial role in transforming Singapore from a developing nation into a prosperous and modern city-state. He has implemented pragmatic economic policies, emphasising education and meritocracy. His leadership fostered political stability, economic growth, and social cohesion. He is widely credited for Singapore's remarkable development and is recognised as a visionary leader. 

#### **How is the process of evaluation carried out?**

The evaluation is carried out through a rigorous two-tier process made up of both the Prize Council and Nominating Committee. The jury panels are composed of renowned professionals and experts in the fields of urban governance and planning, architecture, etc.

The Nominating Committee thoroughly reviews all submitted nominations before making a shortlist of potential Laureates. These possibilities are examined further with the individual merits of each carefully considered. The Prize Council is presented with a final shortlist and selects the Laureate based on the recommendations.

With the many high-quality nominations from cities worldwide, the greatest challenge is how to evaluate them across the board. For that, we have distilled a set of fundamental principles, including the impact of the urban initiatives implemented, the sustainability of the achieved outcomes, the practical purpose and levels of innovation that were demonstrated.  

#### **How does the Prize differ from the quality of life rankings?**

Unlike liveability rankings, the Prize looks at the holistic transformation of a city over at least a decade, and is currently the only international award for cities that does so. There are four key aspects that the Prize looks into when assessing the nominations, namely: liveability, vibrancy, sustainability and a high quality of life. 

Beyond just liveability, nominations are rigorously evaluated based on demonstration of strong leadership and governance, creativity and innovation in the overall master plan or master strategy, good and replicable urban practices, as well as the long-term sustainability and impact of implementation. These are the elements that are missing from liveability surveys and rankings.

#### **Could Special Mentions be eligible to be a future Prize Laureate?**

Yes. As cities are continually growing and evolving, there is always opportunity for Special Mentions to be eligible for the Prize Laureate in future editions. In fact, Medellín and Vienna were recognised as Special Mentions in 2014 and 2016 and went on to become the 2016 and 2020 Prize Laureates respectively.

# **Stage A nominations**

- Leading urban experts, including principal architects, chief city architects, chief urban planners, chief urban designers, principal sustainability consultants, and other related specialists, preferably holding key appointments at the city level or in firms with regional or international presence.

Self-nominations (i.e. nominations made by the city administration for their own city) are strictly not accepted.

There is no limit to the number of nominations a nominator can make. Each nomination must be accompanied by an official nomination form[^1]. The city must agree to be nominated and follow through the Stage B submissions.

The nominator shall make the nominations using the official nomination form[^1], accompanied by a recommendation letter to support why the city should win the Prize. The nominator shall ensure that the city agrees to be nominated and follows through the Stage B submission process. 

#### **How will I know if my nomination is received?**

The nominator and the city will receive an automated e-mail reply to acknowledge the receipt of the nomination. The Prize Secretariat will follow up shortly on additional information and details required for the city's Stage B submission.

#### **Is there an entry fee for making a nomination?**

No. There are no fees required for both Stage A and B.

#### **What should the Stage A recommendation form contain?**

The following are some guiding points for the nominator:

- Demonstration of good governance and leadership

- Key agents and urban actors/stakeholders involved (e.g. governments, government agencies, consultants, communities) and their roles in the transformation of the city
