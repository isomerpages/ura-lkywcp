The Stage A Nomination(s) must be initiated by independent third parties i.e. "Nominator(s)". Cities that are interested to participate in the Prize should approach a Nominator to nominate them. Likewise, the Nominator should inform the city of his/her intention to nominate the city.

The Nominator should be someone belonging to one of the following categories:

| 1 | Leading academics (e.g. professors in universities) |
| 2 | Government officials (outside of the city administration) |
| 3 | Heads of international organisations in the fields of urban planning, housing, transport management, urban design and architecture, energy conservation, urban policy and management, or other relevant fields. |
| 4 | Organisations in the public or private sectors |
| 5 | Non-government organisations (NGOs) |
| 6 | Academic institutions |

**Note:** Self-nominations (i.e. nominations made by the city administration for their own city) are strictly not accepted.

#### **Making the Nomination (by the Nominator)**

The Nominator must make the nomination for each city using the official Nomination Form, accompanied by a signed Recommendation Letter (maximum 600 words). In the Recommendation Letter, the Nominator should make a case to support why the city should win the Prize, and could address (but not limited to) the following points:

| 1 | Outstanding leadership and governance |
| 2 | Successful urban transformation and/or urban solutions with long-term impact |
| 3 | Creative/innovative urban solutions |
| 4 | Potential good learning points for other cities around the world |
