<b><font color="#967942">WELLINGTON</font></b> is recognised for its exemplary commitment towards living with nature. The city stands out for its steadfast dedication to conserving and restoring natural habitat in both urban and natural areas through innovative programmes. Wellington's success stems from extensive citizen engagement and involvement in rewilding efforts, promoting environmental conservation, social cohesion, and community spirit – an exemplary model for harmonious urban-nature coexistence. 

#### **Biophilic city at the forefront of ecological restoration**

As a founding member of the Biophilic Cities Network, Wellington exemplified the vision of people living in harmony with nature through initiatives like **<mark>Zealandia Ecosanctuary</mark>**. Just two kilometres from the Central Business District, it features the world’s first predator exclusion fence, contributing to the increase in bird numbers over the past decade. This increase includes a remarkable 41 per cent year-on-year increase in native bird species per bird count, alongside the resurgence of the Takahē, once presumed extinct. 

Beyond nature areas, the **<mark>Predator Free Wellington project</mark>** aims to make Wellington the world's first predator-free capital, achieving notable success in urban areas like Miramar, a suburb in Wellington, with the eradication of Norway rats and weasels and a 550 per cent increase in fantail birds. These initiatives demonstrate the success of Wellington’s long-term strategy ‘Wellington Towards 2040: Smart Capital’ incepted in 2011. 

#### **Integral community partnership**

Wellington's achievements are deeply rooted in strong and extensive community support, aligning with the city’s vision. The Predator Free Wellington initiative mobilises 58 community trapping groups with thousands of volunteers, raising awareness of the issues, fostering a sense of belonging, especially among marginalised individuals. 

Similarly, the **<mark>Makara Peak Bike Park</mark>**, a blend of recreation and conservation, thrives with community support, involving volunteers in building 40 kilometres of trails, planting 60,000 native plants, and securing NZD 130,000 in funds and 2,500 volunteer hours to build a suspension bridge. Embracing the country's bicultural identity, the city collaborates closely with local Māori groups in many of the works that they do, as exemplified by projects like public art for the Paneke Pōneke Bike Network Plan. 

#### **Novel approaches designed to fulfil strategic aims**

Wellington's ecological projects, notably Zealandia, have produced a wealth of research and knowledge, prompting the city to share its expertise globally as the patent on its fence design expires. Meanwhile, Predator Free Wellington prioritises public education, disseminating information through instructional guidebooks to enhance awareness within the community. This concerted effort not only empowers residents with the tools to participate actively in predator control but also strengthen community bonds, enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of conservation efforts.

Wellington’s success story in ecological restoration will serve as an inspiration for communities and cities worldwide, demonstrating that urban development and nature conservation can co-exist, is enriching and sustainable. Its other ongoing and upcoming projects, such as waterfront rejuvenation and street enhancement work, will help the city further enhance its liveability and vibrancy. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
