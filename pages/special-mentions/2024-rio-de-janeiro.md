<b><font color="#967942">RIO DE JANEIRO</font></b> is recognised for taking bold moves to redefine its central area and waterfront, moving away from decades of a mono-functional downtown and suburban sprawl – a legacy from its historical development since the 1980s. Through strategic implementation of innovative land transfer policies, financing mechanisms and an evidence-based programming approach, the city is poised to shift public mindsets and set in a motion a transformation towards a more attractive, liveable, and vibrant downtown.  

#### **Redefining urban development paradigms** 

Rio demonstrated political will in **<mark>shifting its urban development paradigm</mark>**, as exemplified by the 2013 removal of the coastal Perimetral Elevated Highway – a pivotal moment in its urban evolution, leading to a 3.4-kilometre pedestrianised boulevard along the waterfront. Lined with cultural institutions and event venues, this new urban corridor continues to draw visitors back to the city centre. At the same time, eight kilometres of surface roads rerouted into a tunnel 46 metres below sea level increased traffic capacity by 50 per cent. Today, the waterfront area thrives as a lively district, featuring urban plazas, pedestrian zones, sustainable transportation, and cultural landmarks like the MAR Museum of Art and Museum of Tomorrow.  

#### **Adopting a multi-prong approach to revitalise the centre** 

Rio is commendable for its focused approach to rejuvenate its dormant downtown following the pandemic. Formulated from a comprehensive benchmarking exercise, **<mark>Reviver Centro</mark>** is an initiative that positions the city’s existing cultural assets as catalysts for transformation. To revive its economy, the **<mark>Porto Maravalley project</mark>** leverages technology and innovation to attract and develop tech talents and startups in a former warehouse district. Furthermore, Rio has successfully staged several global events such as 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics to draw visitors to the city. 

Meanwhile, the city gains momentum in converting disused sites into cultural uses and facilitated the licensing of 2,300 new residential units through subsidies and strategic land transfers for private building owners. Within its downtown **<mark>Low Emission District</mark>**, the promotion of active mobility and greenways, as opposed to cars, addresses emissions-related concerns while fostering a safer urban environment. Furthermore, Rio’s dedication to honour its African heritage, notably through the restoration of the UNESCO World Heritage Site **<mark>Valongo Wharf</mark>**, emphasises its commitment to inclusivity. 

#### **Financing and sustaining urban development innovatively**

Rio's innovation in financing and sustaining urban development is exemplified by the establishment of **<mark>CCPAR</mark>**, a public company that introduced certificates for air rights in Porto Maravilha. This initiative introduced a novel financing mechanism for air rights negotiations. A new law in 2009 enabled the expansion of floor area within Porto Maravilha and allowed developers and landowners to purchase titles for increased floor space. Strategically, the city sold all these rights to a federal bank, ensuring a capital infusion for other critical development areas. Subsequently, the bank undertook the negotiation of these rights with developers and landowners, providing flexibility in setting preferred rates. This innovative approach fostered a mutually-beneficial scenario, aligning the interests of all parties involved in a win-win arrangement.

While Rio’s current plans show promise in addressing urban flight in its downtown area, many of its initiatives are at the initial phase of implementation. Continued efforts and leadership support can help to ensure that the city's urban transformation is enduring and sustainable. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
