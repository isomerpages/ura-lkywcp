#### **Key issues**

Rio de Janeiro’s central district faced several key issues. Historically, the area had transformed into a highly concentrated business district as industries and businesses evolved, leading to a shift from mixed-use development to single-use commercial spaces. This resulted in a loss of residential activities and a lack of affordable housing options. The COVID-19 pandemic then caused a significant economic setback, leading to a decrease in economic activity and investment. Many commercial buildings were abandoned or underused, further undermining the district’s prospects.

#### **Objectives**

The project aims to revitalise Rio’s central district by addressing its pressing challenges and outlining a vision for its future. The project seeks to reverse the loss of population by attracting residents back to the area, creating a vibrant and diverse community. It fosters a sense of local community and belonging, promoting social cohesion and a shared vision for the future. The project provides incentives for social and affordable housing, repurposes underused buildings into residential units, and establishes the central district as a liveable option, reducing daily commutes and urban sprawl. By achieving this vision, the project creates a sustainable and liveable central district that serves as a model for urban revitalisation.

#### **Key strategies**

Firstly, the project offers urban and legal incentives for the conversion of underused commercial buildings into residential apartments. These incentives encourage property owners and developers to convert commercial spaces into residential units, increasing the availability of housing options in the central district. This approach not only provides more housing options but also breathes new life into previously underutilised buildings, enhancing the district’s aesthetic appeal.

Secondly, the project has introduced a crossed urban bonus system to incentivise the construction or retrofitting of residential units in the central district. This system enables individuals or organisations to earn bonuses for building or renovating residential properties, which can be used to exceed legal restrictions in other high-value areas of the city. This strategy promotes balanced urban growth and encourages investment in the central district, creating a more vibrant and liveable community.

Thirdly, the project has simplified building codes and processes, streamlining procedures and expediting approval processes. This aims to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and enable the rapid development of housing options, facilitating the transformation of the central district into a vibrant and liveable area. By implementing these strategies, the project seeks to create a more attractive and sustainable community for residents, enhancing their quality of life and promoting a sense of belonging.

#### **Impacts**

The project has made a significant positive impact on the urban environment and the local community. In less than two years, the programme has licensed 2,300 new residential units in the central region. Additionally, 700 units are currently in the process of being licensed, which will increase the local population by approximately 15 percent once built.

The project’s success has also led to a change in national Civil Law, making it easier to transform commercial suites into residential units. The introduction of a new law has reduced the approval rate threshold among condominium owners, streamlining the process and removing a potential barrier.

The federal government has also pledged its support to the programme, committing to allocate its empty lots in the central district for the construction of social housing. By leveraging the benefits provided by the programme, these empty lots will be utilised to meet the demand for affordable housing options.

The combination of increased licensed residential units, legal changes, and government commitment highlights the tangible results achieved by the project. It has addressed the pressing need for housing in the central district, stimulated economic growth, fostered community development, and improved the overall liveability of the area. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
