#### **Key issues**

As a major job generation centre, Rio de Janeiro’s central region experiences high traffic and transportation demands, leading to congestion and inefficiencies. The district struggled with a reliance on shared transportation modes, resulting in congestion and inefficiencies. Although the area’s boundaries encompass non-polluting transport modes like tram and Metro, these are not fully utilised to address the transportation challenges. Despite previous improvements, the district still faces challenges like problematic vehicle circulation, blurred pedestrian and vehicle areas, and safety concerns. The city has identified key areas for improvement, including enhancing green spaces, accessibility, and infrastructure quality, as well as addressing pressing issues like security, economic crisis, and pandemic impacts.

#### **Objectives**

As a major job generation centre, Rio de Janeiro’s central region experiences high traffic and transportation demands, leading to congestion and inefficiencies. The district struggled with a reliance on shared transportation modes, resulting in congestion and inefficiencies. Although the area’s boundaries encompass non-polluting transport modes like tram and Metro, these are not fully utilised to address the transportation challenges. Despite previous improvements, the district still faces challenges like problematic vehicle circulation, blurred pedestrian and vehicle areas, and safety concerns. The city has identified key areas for improvement, including enhancing green spaces, accessibility, and infrastructure quality, as well as addressing pressing issues like security, economic crisis, and pandemic impacts.

#### **Key strategies**

The Low Emissions District prioritises sustainability by promoting green infrastructure, active transport, and accessibility. This is achieved through the following key areas:

- Urban Requalification involves implementing nature-based solutions and green infrastructure to enhance urban spaces and improve accessibility.
- Active Mobility encourages walkability, cyclist-friendly infrastructure, and clean vehicles to reduce emissions.
- Clean Technology promotes electric vehicles, hybrid technologies, and sustainable transportation practices.
- Air Quality monitoring and improvement is achieved through stricter emission standards and afforestation.
- Waste management practices are implemented through recycling and waste reduction initiatives.
- Buildings are made energy efficient through green construction materials, efficient insulation, and smart energy management systems.
- Communication and Participation involve educating the public on sustainable practices and encouraging community involvement in decision-making processes.
- A comprehensive monitoring system tracks air quality, emissions, and pedestrian and vehicle flow.

#### **Impacts**

The Low Emissions District has made a significant impact on the urban environment and local community by implementing innovative strategies that prioritise sustainable mobility and a greener urban landscape. By expanding the bicycle path network, promoting pedestrian-friendly urban requalification, encouraging the use of clean vehicles, and increasing tree planting, the project has reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased tree planting and green areas, promoted active and clean transport, contributed to a healthier urban environment, and supported the clean energy market.

The project has brought numerous benefits to the community, including a healthier urban environment, reduced health problems, increased occupation of the central area, and a stimulated clean energy market. By 2024, the project aims to implement the Low Emissions District in the central region, covering 35,000 square metres of public spaces. By 2030, the goal is to expand the District to the entire perimeter of 2.34 square kilometres and eliminate GHG emissions from mobile sources. These targets demonstrate the Low Emissions District’s commitment to reducing climate change and transitioning to a sustainable future. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
