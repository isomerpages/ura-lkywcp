#### **Key issues**

Before its transformation, several key issues hindered Green Point Common’s potential as a public space. The site’s disjointed layout and underutilisation resulted from a lack of coherence and function. Sports clubs dominated the Common, limiting opportunities for other uses by residents. Neglect and disrepair characterised many clubhouses and facilities.

Environmental concerns posed significant challenges, a poor soil conditions and severe prevailing winds impeded development. Moreover, finding a sustainable water supply source for irrigation was crucial, as relying on potable water was not financially, morally, or environmentally viable. Finally, the community raised concerns about the redevelopment’s impact on traffic, noise, visual impact, financial viability, and environmental sustainability.

#### **Objectives**

The development was guided by principles like environmental quality, safety, and integration. The design aimed to create an interactive ecological space showcasing local biodiversity and indigenous plant species. The park would feature flexible public areas for sports, recreation, and education, with free entry. It would also integrate with surrounding buildings, including the 2010 Cape Town Soccer Stadium. A key goal was sustainable water use, with plans to harness spring water from Table Mountain for irrigation, storing it in ponds and wetlands across the park.

#### **Key strategies**

Green Point Park was developed with several key strategies in mind. The city’s environmental principles were integrated into the public urban setting to create a sustainable space. Water-wise horticulture was used throughout the park to minimise water consumption and showcase drought-resistant plants. The city’s diverse array of indigenous flora and fauna was displayed to promote biodiversity and educate visitors. The park’s design took a strategic approach to demonstrate how humans, nature, and flora can coexist constructively in an urban environment.

The city’s commitment to sustainability was evident in the park’s maintenance activities, which embedded environmental best practices and regular soil and water testing to ensure long-term sustainability. Specialist consultants and invertebrate studies were employed to monitor the development of fauna in the park’s water bodies. Additionally, the city prioritised visitor safety, implementing extensive security measures including 24-hour visible security, strict opening and closing hours, 24-hour CCTV surveillance, and access control. These measures aimed to create a welcoming and secure environment for all visitors to enjoy.

#### **Impacts**

Green Point Park has had a significant positive impact on the urban environment and local community. The park now showcases biodiversity, with endemic trees and plants attracting fauna such as birds and even apex predators like the African clawless otter. The park’s green space also provides a habitat for local wildlife, offsets carbon emissions, combats air and noise pollution, and contributes to lessening urban crime. Additionally, the park’s water features, ponds, and wetlands use water sourced from Cape Town’s original springs, saving approximately 580 million litres of water annually.

The park has also become an educational hub, with resources built around the water bodies to teach young city residents about nature and water dynamics. The biodiversity show garden and experiential educational garden provide interactive learning experiences. The park has also hosted various events, including the Formula-E Racing World Championship, which generated significant economic spinoffs and promoted sustainability.

The park’s impacts extend beyond the environment, with property values in the surrounding area increasing dramatically since its development. The park is wellserviced by public transport and has become a hub for social cohesion, attracting over one million visitors annually from diverse backgrounds. The city’s continued investment in the park has contributed to economic growth and job creation, demonstrating that sustainability and economic activity can coexist and even thrive together **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
