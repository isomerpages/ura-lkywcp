#### **Key issues**

Mexico City faced challenges in providing connectivity and access to information and communication technologies, particularly in underserved areas. This led to a digital divide, with many residents, especially in low-income neighbourhoods, lacking access to the internet and digital
services. Additionally, government services were often inefficient, relying on physical paperwork, and lacked transparency.

#### **Objectives**

The objectives of the project are to provide free Wi-Fi to bridge the digital divide and empower citizens with access to information and communication technologies, establish a digital authentication system (Llave CDMX) to enable government validation of digital identity and simplify access to public services, implement a Digital Record to provide a centralised platform for citizens to access and view shared
documents, reducing the need for physical paperwork, and automate administrative process management through the Procedures Digitiser tool, streamlining procedure handling and making government services more efficient and transparent.

#### **Key strategies**

**Free Wi-Fi**: The expansion of free Wi-Fi is a major project which has already provided internet access to over one million citizens through 31,081 access points. This achievement was made possible by utilising existing infrastructure and minimising environmental impact. This initiative enables citizens to access digital services and information, promoting digital inclusion and bridging the gap for underserved communities.

**LLave CDMX**: LLave CDMX is a digital identity system that simplifies and digitises procedures. This innovative solution has reduced the number of government procedures from 2,000 to 565, increasing efficiency and reducing bureaucratic delays. Additionally, the Digital Agency for Public Innovation has developed over 280 proprietary software solutions, achieving technological independence and providing citizens with digital tools and services. This demonstrates the city’s commitment to leveraging technology for citizen-centric services.

**Procedures Digitiser**: The Procedures Digitiser involves homogenising and standardising business processes, creating a tool to reduce development time, and implementing a new platform development strategy. By enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery, this project reduces errors and facilitates seamless interactions between stakeholders.

#### **Impacts**

**Free Wi-Fi**: Since 2019, Mexico City has increased its free public WiFi hotspots from 98 to a Guinness World Record of over 21,500. By the end of 2024, the number is projected to reach 34,001, extending coverage to the most vulnerable periphery areas, public schools, and transportation citywide. The project has successfully provided internet access to over 8.8 million residents, representing 95 percent of the population, with 110.2 million connections and 12.9 million unique users.

**LLave CDMX**: The LLave CDMX digital authenticator has resulted in a savings of 1.3 billion Mexican pesos by digitising procedures, reducing opportunities for corruption and ensuring resources reach government accounts. Digitising procedures also contributes to savings in paper, energy, and water consumption. From a social perspective, this initiative simplifies administrative processes, making them clearer, easier, more accessible, and accurate for the public.

**Procedures Digitiser**: The Procedures Digitiser has significantly reduced the time required for digitising procedures, achieving a six-fold reduction in time needed. This project also brings substantial cost savings, reducing man-hours by 80 percent and development time by 75 percent. The digitalisation tool empowers the functional team to participate in digitising procedures, expanding the capacity to digitise and improve service delivery. The project aims to create a unique platform for agile interaction between the government and citizens, simplifying administrative processes and enhancing convenience. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
