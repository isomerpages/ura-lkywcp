#### **Key issues**

Twenty years ago, the native bird population in the city was on the brink of extinction, with the majority of species found only on offshore islands. The introduction of predators during European colonisation period had a devastating impact on the mainland population. Despite this, there were still efforts to restore the ecosystem, leading to the establishment of Zealandia Te Mãra a Tãne, an eco-sanctuary that has become a haven for native birds. However, the surrounding city environment remained a challenge, with urbanisation and human activities posing a threat to the long-term survival of the restored ecosystem.

#### **Objectives**

The project aims to achieve a 500-year vision of restoration, with the goal of restoring the biodiversity of the 225-hectare valley to its pre-colonial state. The project’s objectives go beyond the sanctuary’s fences, seeking to transform how people live with nature in towns, cities, and beyond. The project aims to create a sustainable and resilient ecosystem, where native birds and other species can thrive, and where people can connect with nature and appreciate its beauty and importance. By achieving this vision, the project hopes to set a new standard for urban conservation and restoration and inspire similar initiatives nationwide.

#### **Key strategies**

In 2000, the city set aside 225 hectares of land, just 2 kilometres from the city centre, to create a sanctuary for native species and improve stormwater management. This innovative project, Zealandia, features a world-first predator exclusion fence, which has enabled the reintroduction of 23 rare and endangered species, including kiwi and other animals. Today, many of these species have thrived and extended beyond the fence, with some even nesting in residents’ backyards.

Zealandia also focuses on restoring the freshwater ecosystem, reintroducing native fish species like the toitoi/common bully and kãkahi (freshwater mussels). This holistic approach aims to revive the entire ecosystem.

As a true community partnership, Zealandia works closely with mana whenua (the local Mãori iwi) to develop projects and incorporate mãtauranga Mãori (Mãori knowledge) into their activities. Thousands of volunteers have contributed to planting, weeding, and caring for the sanctuary, establishing a flourishing forest ecosystem. Currently, over 500 active volunteers work in various areas of the organisation.

Zealandia’s impact extends beyond the fence, with initiatives like youth learning programmes, the urban catchment restoration project ‘Sanctuary to Sea Kia Mouriora te Kaiwharawhara’, and research on how to support people living in harmony with nature. By working together, Zealandia is setting a new standard for urban conservation and restoration.

#### **Impacts**

Zealandia’s innovative approach has made a significant impact on the environment and community. By excluding 15 introduced predators and browsers, the sanctuary has created a safe space for native forests and animals to thrive. This success has had a ripple effect across the city, making Wellington one of the only cities in the world where native bird biodiversity is increasing. Zealandia’s programmes have inspired a new generation to live in harmony with nature:

- Education and engagement programmes for young people, particularly in disadvantaged communities, to inspire a love for nature and empower communities to take action.
- The Sanctuary to Sea Kia Mouriora te Kaiwharawhara project, a community partnership to address urban waterway issues and promote sustainable management.
- A vibrant research programme, in partnership with Victoria University of Wellington, to discover how to create naturerich cities of the future.
- Regenerative tourism, which funds the mission and impact work, inspiring visitors to take action and connect with conservation efforts.

Zealandia is recognized as a nationally significant biodiversity hotspot and haven for wildlife. The sanctuary’s success has inspired the national Predator Free New Zealand initiative, aiming to eradicate possums, stoats, and rats from the mainland. Citizen science data shows a transformational change in species such as kãkã, now nesting in Wellington’s backyards. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
