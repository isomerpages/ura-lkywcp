#### **Key issues**

In the past, Lisbon's public spaces faced several pressing challenges. Many areas were heavily degraded and discontinuous, limiting universal accessibility, particularly for individuals with reduced mobility. This lack of accessibility created feelings of exclusion among certain community members, making these spaces less inclusive and useful.

The public areas were underused, lacking vibrancy and community engagement. Social interactions were limited, and recreational use of the spaces was sparse, contributing to a decline in community life.

Environmental concerns worsened the situation. Extensive parking areas encouraged heavy car use, leading to high levels of traffic, noise, and air pollution. Sustainable travel options, such as walking or cycling, were scarce, making these public spaces even less appealing.

#### **Objectives**

The project aimed to create new social centres where people could meet and interact, establishing vibrant hubs that reflected the diversity of Lisbon’s communities. By fostering social connections, the goal was to revive the sense of community within neighbourhoods. Another focus was to improve the quality of public spaces by increasing areas for pedestrian movement, leisure, and relaxation, while expanding green spaces and tree cover to create inviting environments that encourage community engagement and outdoor activities.

Reducing car traffic and speed was also a key objective. This involved reorganising parking and promoting alternative modes of transport for short distances, such as walking and cycling. The project sought to boost the use of public and commercial spaces by encouraging the establishment of pavement cafés and supporting private initiatives, thereby stimulating local economies. Involving local communities and parish councils at every stage - from development to construction - ensured the project aligned with the needs and desires of residents.

#### **Key strategies**

To achieve the project’s objectives, several strategic actions were implemented. A citywide municipal programme was established to guide public interventions, promoting territorial cohesion and healthier lifestyle choices. This framework ensured that interventions were not only localised but also aligned with broader urban development goals.

The requalification of public spaces was a key focus. Areas with potential for communal use were enhanced by revitalising existing gathering places or creating new ones, transforming them into focal points for community interaction. This was essential for reshaping the urban landscape and fostering social cohesion.

Efforts to reduce car traffic were critical to the project's success. Expanding pedestrian areas and introducing cycle paths where feasible aimed to create a more walkable and bike-friendly environment. This initiative was part of the City Governance Programme 2013/2017 and aligned with the _Lisbon: City of Neighbourhoods_ concept, which emphasised participatory and democratic governance. Collaboration among municipal services and community stakeholders ensured transparency and effectiveness throughout the implementation process.

#### **Impacts**

The project has brought about significant positive changes in both the urban environment and the local community. Public spaces and pavement cafés have seen increased use, with wide pavements now serving both circulation and social purposes. This transformation has revitalised neighbourhoods, creating spaces where residents can connect and engage.

The project has also fostered a new urban dynamic, promoting the renovation of commercial establishments and the proliferation of pavement cafés. Over five years, public participation in discussions grew markedly, with higher attendance at public sessions and increased online engagement from community members. This greater involvement has empowered residents and ensured that the project continues to meet their needs and expectations.

Travel behaviour has shifted significantly as well. A study showed that the number of cyclists increased by six to seven times, and pedestrian activity rose by 2.5 times from 2016 to 2017, indicating a move towards more sustainable transport modes. Municipal investment in public spaces has spurred private investment, leading to building renovations, enhanced local commerce, and job creation. These combined impacts highlight the project’s success in revitalising both Lisbon's physical environment and its community spirit. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
