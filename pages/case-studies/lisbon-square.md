#### **Key issues**

Before the implementation of the project "A Square in Each Neighbourhood," Lisbon faced several significant challenges in its public spaces. The existing public areas were heavily degraded and often discontinuous, which hindered universal accessibility for individuals with reduced mobility. This lack of accessibility contributed to a sense of exclusion among certain community members, further diminishing the utility of these spaces.

In addition, public spaces were largely underutilised, resulting in a lack of vibrancy in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Community members rarely engaged with these areas for leisure or relaxation, which ultimately led to a decline in social interactions and community life. The presence of extensive parking for cars exacerbated the situation, causing high levels of traffic, sound, and air pollution. This environmental degradation was compounded by the scarcity of sustainable travel habits, particularly concerning walking and cycling, further diminishing the appeal of these public spaces.

#### **Objectives**

One of the primary goals was to create or develop new social centres where people could meet and interact, establishing hubs that reflect the diversity of Lisbon’s communities. By fostering these social connections, the project aimed to revive the sense of community within the neighbourhoods. Another objective was to enhance the quality of public spaces. This involved increasing the areas dedicated to pedestrian movement, leisure, and relaxation while also expanding green spaces and tree cover. The intention was to create inviting environments that encourage community engagement and outdoor activities.

Reducing car traffic and speed was also a significant objective of the project. This included reorganising parking and promoting alternative modes of transportation for short distances, such as walking and cycling. The project sought to incentivise the use of public and commercial spaces by encouraging the establishment of pavement cafés and supporting private initiatives, which would help stimulate local economies. Finally, involving local communities and parish councils in every stage of the project—from development to construction—was essential for ensuring that the project met the needs and desires of the residents.

#### **Key strategies**

To achieve these objectives, several strategic actions were implemented. A citywide municipal programme was established to guide public interventions, promoting principles of territorial cohesion and healthier lifestyle choices. This framework ensured that the interventions were not only localised but also aligned with broader urban development goals.

The requalification of public spaces was a major focus of the project. Areas that had the potential for communal use were enhanced, either by revitalising existing gathering places or by creating new ones that could serve as focal points for community interaction. This process was integral to transforming the urban landscape and promoting social cohesion.

Efforts to reduce car traffic were also crucial to the project's success. By expanding pedestrian areas and introducing cycle paths where feasible, the project aimed to create a more walkable and bike-friendly environment. The initiative was part of the City Governance Programme 2013/2017 and aligned with the Lisbon: City of Neighbourhoods concept, which emphasised participatory and democratic governance. By fostering collaboration among municipal services and community stakeholders, the project aimed to ensure transparency and effectiveness throughout the implementation process.

#### **Impacts**

The project has led to significant positive changes in both the urban environment and the local community. There has been a noticeable increase in the use of public spaces and pavement cafés, with wide pavements now serving dual purposes for circulation and social gatherings. This transformation has invigorated the neighbourhoods, creating spaces where residents can connect and engage with one another.

Moreover, the project has fostered a new urban dynamic, encouraging the renovation of commercial establishments and the proliferation of pavement cafés. Over five years, public participation in project discussions increased significantly, evidenced by higher attendance at public sessions and greater online engagement from community members. This enhanced involvement has not only empowered residents but also ensured that the project remains aligned with their needs and expectations.

In addition, the project has led to a substantial change in travel behavior. A study indicated that the volume of cyclists increased by 6 to 7 times and pedestrian circulation rose 2.5 times from 2016 to 2017, showcasing a shift towards more sustainable modes of transport. The municipal investment in rehabilitating public spaces has also spurred private investment, leading to the renovation of buildings, enhanced local commerce, and job creation. These combined impacts illustrate the project's success in revitalizing both the physical environment and the community spirit of Lisbon. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
