        subtitle: 
        description: A successful city requires a forward-looking, comprehensive, and sustainable approach to urban challenges. Strong leadership, governance, and effective structures are crucial. The Prize has evolved to recognise cities as a whole, considering the complexity of development, stakeholder engagement, and measurable improvements in citizens' lives. The Prize provides a holistic assessment of a city, and one that inspires cities of distinction.
