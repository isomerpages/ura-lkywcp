All submissions are evaluated through a rigorous two-tier process comprising the Nominating Committee and Prize Council. Both panels consist of prominent practitioners, policy makers, academics and experts from a wide range of disciplines in the public and private sectors. The roles of the two panels are as follows: 

#### **Nominating Committee**

The Nominating Committee reviews and examines submissions, and recommends potential Laureates to the Prize Council
