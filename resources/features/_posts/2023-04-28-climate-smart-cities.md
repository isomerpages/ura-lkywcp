From more frequent and intense adverse weather events to rising sea level, the impact of climate change on cities is multi-faceted and [likely to worsen over time](https://www.livescience.com/is-the-weather-getting-worse). Increasingly, cities are adopting smart technologies as part of their strategies to mitigate such impact. 

These technologies, with their ability to integrate and process raw data from sensors and cameras through data analytics platforms and digital solutions, help cities address the impact of climate change. For instance, real-time ground data provide accurate, up-to-date information on critical parameters such as stormwater levels and ambient temperatures, which in turn allow cities to make informed decisions to avert or mitigate the impact of related crises. 

Such systems provide other benefits as well – such as long-term cost savings and enhancing the quality of life for citizens. As smart technologies become more widely adopted, they demonstrate that such investment goes a long way in boosting the climate resilience and liveability of cities.

#### **Managing flooding risks**

Flooding, especially for low-lying cities, has become far more serious in recent years with the increase in rainfall, sea level rise, and changes in weather patterns. Besides traditional measures such as sea walls and storm drains networks, coastal cities have also introduced smart systems to help manage their vulnerabilities.

Norfolk, a coastal city in Virginia, United States is one such flood-prone city that piloted a storm sensor system led by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science between 2016 and 2018. Water-level sensors were installed in selected locations to gather data on the intrusion of tidal waters and capacity of stormwater systems, and allowed emergency responders and city officials to forecast flooding risks. The system – [‘StormSense’](https://www.wtkr.com/2018/11/06/water-level-sensors-hope-to-get-you-information-faster-about-storms) – has since been scaled up in Norfolk and [replicated in other cities in Virginia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31092957/). Norfolk has also recently [partnered Google](https://www.govtech.com/analytics/norfolk-va-offers-real-time-flood-data-to-drivers) to furnish drivers with real-time alerts on flooded roads. 

In Mumbai, India, increasingly severe flash floods have disrupted its economy and livelihoods. On top of improving its drainage systems, the government has recently [installed more automated weather stations](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/60-more-automatic-weather-stns-to-help-enhance-flood-prediction/articleshow/98031237.cms) to gather rainfall data, which in turn supports flood forecasting via an integrated flood warning system. Additionally, the city has [launched an app](https://localpress.co.in/mumbai-snippets/ministry-launches-mumbai-weather-live-app-to-warn-mumbaikars-about-extreme-weather-events/) which provides live location-specific information such as rainfall and winds to help citizens pre-empt floods and other extreme weather events. 

In Rotterdam, the Netherlands, flooding risk is exceptionally high with [four-fifths of the city below sea level](https://www.thestar.com/news/atkinsonseries/2021/01/07/rotterdam-is-using-smart-city-tech-to-solve-pressing-urban-problems-heres-what-canadian-cities-can-learn-from-the-dutch-model.html).  “As a low-lying city in the Dutch river delta, Rotterdam is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Climate adaptation – adapting Rotterdam to climate change – is absolutely essential,” [said Arno Bonte](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/storage.resilientrotterdam.nl/storage/2022/09/09093215/Resilient-Rotterdam-Strategy-2022-2027.pdf), Vice Mayor for sustainability, air quality, energy transition and resilience.  

The city has implemented an [innovative approach](https://www.corporateknights.com/built-environment/rotterdam-uses-smart-tech-to-save-city-from-drowning/) to reduce flood risks by creating a network of green roofs acting as storm water reservoirs. Electronic valves in the tanks can be operated remotely to release the water when the drainage systems are less taxed. By linking these roofs to the weather forecast, the roofs automatically adjust their storage by releasing water in advance when heavy rains are predicted. 

#### **Capitalising on strategic interventions**

Small but strategic interventions go a long way in remaking Lisbon. In 2017, Lisbon launched [‘A Square in Each Neighbourhood’](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266668392200058X) programme, where the city works with residents to create or revamp public and green spaces. For instance, in the [neighbourhood of Campolide](https://una.city/nbs/lisboa/square-each-neighbourhood-street-campolide), the city widened the pavements, created playgrounds and outdoor seating areas, and eliminated a road lane.  

Sofia Mourão, Municipal Director of Urbanism, Lisbon City Council, who spearheaded the programme, highlights the impact of the initiative, “The goal of the programme was to create liveable and friendly public areas to entice people to leave their house, enjoy the city, shop, and socialise. We design the spaces for pedestrian success, with new green areas. The construction of squares encourages further private investments, triggering the rehabilitation of buildings, boosting commerce, and creating jobs.” 

The riverfront is one of Lisbon’s most iconic attractions today. Prior to urban renewal in the 2000s, however, much of it was inaccessible port-owned areas. While major projects such as new plazas and museums redefined the waterfront, [smaller interventions](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/10/5665) too played a critical role. Green spaces, boardwalks, and walkways reduce car movements and provide continuous public spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy. On weekends, road closures on stretches along the riverfront add further to the vibrancy.  

To celebrate and enhance the distinctive character of its neighbourhoods, the city taps on interventions such as street art and events. In Alfama, the city [commissioned street artist Vhils](https://www.streetartbio.com/guides/street-art-city-walks-lisbon/) to create a portrait of Amalia Rodrigues – a singer who popularised ‘Fado’ (a music genre originating in Lisbon) and had a song named after the historic district – using traditional Portuguese paving stones.

In Mouraria, new immigrants in recent decades give rise to a multi-ethnic character aside from the district’s Moorish heritage. In one of its plazas, Martim Moniz, the city established the ['Mercado de Fusao'](https://www.coe.int/en/web/interculturalcities/-/the-fusion-market-mercado-de-fusao-) (Fusion Market), where street food from different parts of the world is sold daily. The market not only acknowledges Mouraria’s diverse communities, but also brings in new visitors to rediscover the district.

#### **Committing to sustainability**

The first Southern European city to be named [European Union Green Capital](https://www.circularcityfundingguide.eu/case-studies/lisbon-the-first-eu-green-capital-in-southern-europe/), Lisbon's journey to become greener and more sustainable began during the 2008 global financial crisis, with a sustainable development strategy to create a better environment and reduce public expenditure. Its approach is often multi-pronged and targets long-term behavioural change for greater impact. 

A case in point is the city’s efforts to tackle its transport issue. To date, as part of infrastructural investments, Lisbon has built [over 100 kilometres of cycling paths](https://www.themayor.eu/en/a/view/lisbon-plans-for-post-corona-refurbishment-5126?trans=en-US) and an [extensive network of electric vehicle charging points](https://www.uswitch.com/electric-car/ev-charging/european-capitals-best-density-ev-charging-stations/). It [works closely with private operators](https://tomorrow.city/a/lisbon-transport-after-big-crisis) to integrate private supplies of transport, such as shared electric motorcycles and bicycles.  

To effect long-term behavioural change, Lisbon [engages companies](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/4331_Deloitte-City-Mobility-Index/Lisbon_GlobalCityMobility_WEB.pdf) to adopt sustainable mobility measures and comply with the city’s green goals and Corporate Mobility Pact. Under the pact, companies may adopt initiatives such as offering workers mobility credits for bicycles and transport passes and adopting electric vehicles in business fleets. The city [discourages private car use through policies](https://www.centreforcities.org/blog/what-can-british-cities-learn-from-the-portuguese-public-transport-system/) such as parking levies, road pricing systems, and reduced parking lots.

Furthermore, in 2019, the city introduced an integrated transport pass with a monthly price cap of Euro 40 (approx. USD 43), allowing one to use multiple transit modes via a single platform at an accessible cost. As a result, [car purchases in Lisbon fell by 22 percent while train journeys between suburbs and the city centre increased by 25.7 percent](https://www.eltis.org/in-brief/news/mobility-service-partnership-delivers-lisbon-and-neighbouring-evora) in that year alone. In 2022, Lisbon approved free public transport for young people and seniors.  

Lisbon’s solution to food wastage is another example. In 2016, the city implemented a policy strategy to repurpose food waste. It created an integrated digital platform, [Lisboa Zero](https://www.lisboazero.app/en/organic-and-food-waste/), that brings together stakeholders, including food producers, redistributors, and beneficiaries to separate bio-waste at source and redirect surplus food to the city’s less fortunate. The city also [installed 4,000 domestic composters](https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/Cities100-Increasing-resource-recovery-to-tackle-food-waste-in-Lisbon?language=en_US) city-wide for household use, thus reducing food waste transport and incineration.  

While Lisbon still faces other common city challenges such as housing affordability, neighbourhood gentrification, and economic diversification, the last decade has shown that the city is more than ready to find new and innovative ways to address ongoing challenges and reinvent itself to be even more liveable and people-centric. <b><font color="#967942">O</font></b>
