The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize is happy to announce the addition of two distinguished urban experts to its Nominating Committee, Professor Ricky Burdett from LSE Cities and Professor Weiping Wu from Columbia GSAPP.

Professor Ricky Burdett, a globally recognised figure in urban planning and design, is the Director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme at the London School of Economics and Political Science. His extensive research and work on sustainable urban development have earned him international acclaim. Professor Burdett's contributions to understanding and shaping cities will undoubtedly enrich the Prize's selection process. Read his biography [here](/ricky-burdett/).

Professor Weiping Wu, a prominent scholar and urbanist, serves as the Director of the Urban Planning Programme at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP). Her expertise lies in exploring innovative urban strategies and sustainable urbanisation in China. Professor Wu's deep insights into urban dynamics will greatly benefit the Prize's mission to honour outstanding cities with good urban solutions. Read her biography [here](/weiping-wu/).

As the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize continues its mission to honour outstanding cities worldwide, we are excited to have Prof Burdett and Prof Wu on board. Their urban expertise will enhance our efforts in recognising exemplary cities. We also express our gratitude to former committee members Prof Marilyn Jordan Taylor and Prof Wulf Daseking for their invaluable contributions.

#### **New Prize Secretary**

We are also pleased to introduce [Ms Yap Lay Bee](/yap-lay-bee/) as our new Prize Secretary. Currently, she serves as Group Director of Architecture & Urban Design at Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority, bringing extensive experience in urban planning and design. Her role involves shaping Singapore's sustainable and vibrant future through strategic planning and public-private partnerships. We would like to extend our gratitude to former Prize Secretary Mr Larry Ng for his instrumental role in elevating the Prize to its current stature.<b><font color="#967942">O</font></b>
