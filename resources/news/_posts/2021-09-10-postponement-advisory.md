#### **Advisory note**

The upcoming 8th edition of [World Cities Summit](https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg) (WCS) will be rescheduled to 31 July to 3 August 2022 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, in Singapore.  This change of dates will promote greater participation from WCS strategic partners, business leaders, governments and delegates from diverse regions across the world. This decision will also allow WCS to accommodate any additional space that may be required due to COVID-19 safe management measures at large-scale MICE events.

WCS 2022 had originally been scheduled to take place from 17 to 21 April, in conjunction with Singapore International Water Week (SIWW) and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG). SIWW and CESG will proceed with their events as planned in April, at the same venue. [Asia Infrastructure Forum](https://www.infrastructureasia.org) (AIF) will be co-located with WCS on 31 July â€“ 3 August 2022 at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore. This partnership will bring great synergy to both events and benefit their stakeholders.

The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize events (Prize Lecture & Forum, Prize Award Ceremony) will now take place on 1 August 2022 during WCS. Join us at the Summit to learn more from the 2020 Prize Laureate and Special Mentions.
