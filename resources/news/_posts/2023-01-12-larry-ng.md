Mr Larry Ng steps down as the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Secretary on 1 February 2023. Larry has helmed the role of Prize Secretary since the Prize's inauguration in 2009, and was the driving force in shaping the Prize into one of the most prestigious awards for cities today. 

During his tenure, he has made significant contributions to the Prize, including but not limited to expanding the Prize's international network, streamlining processes, and guiding his team towards excellence. His dedication and hard work have played a crucial role in the success of the Prize. Larry's strong passion for cities will continue to inspire us in the search for outstanding cities to join the ranks of the Prize Laureates and share their many achievements and good learning points for other cities around the world.

[Ms Yap Lay Bee](/yap-lay-bee/), Group Director (Architecture & Urban Design), Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Singapore, takes over as the new Prize Secretary. Lay Bee currently leads a multi-disciplinary team of architects and planners in URA to develop urban design plans, and formulate policies and programmes to make Singapore a sustainable, attractive and vibrant global city. Lay Bee is also no stranger to the Prize, having been involved as an understudy of Larry since 2018. 
 
We would like to thank Larry for his service and wish him all the best in his future endeavours. <b><font color="#967942">O</font></b>
