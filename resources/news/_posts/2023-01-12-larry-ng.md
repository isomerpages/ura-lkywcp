Mr Larry Ng, the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Secretary will be stepping down on 1 February 2023. Larry has helmed the role of Prize Secretary since the Prize's inauguration in 2009, and was the driving force in shaping the Prize into its status as one of the most prestigious awards for cities today. 

During his tenure, he has made significant contributions to the Prize, including but not limited to international networking, streamlining processes and guiding his lean team towards excellence. His dedication and hard work have played a crucial role in the success of the Prize. 

Larry's passion for cities and the Prize will not be forgotten and will continue to inspire us in the search for outstanding cities to join the ranks of the Prize Laureates and to share their many achievements and good learning points for other cities around the world. We thank Larry for his service and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

Ms Yap Lay Bee, Group Director of Architecture and Urban Design, Urban Redevelopment Authority Singapore, will take over as the new Prize Secretary.
