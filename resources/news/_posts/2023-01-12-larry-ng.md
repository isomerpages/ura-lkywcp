Mr Larry Ng, the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Secretary will be stepping down on 1 February 2023. Larry has helmed the role of Prize Secretary since the Prize's inauguration in 2009, and was the driving force in shaping the Prize into one of the most prestigious awards for cities today. 

During his tenure, he has made significant contributions to the Prize, including but not limited to expanding the Prize's international network, streamlining processes and guiding his lean team towards excellence. His dedication and hard work have played a crucial role in the success of the Prize. Larry's strong passion for cities will continue to inspire us in the search for outstanding cities to join the ranks of the Prize Laureates and share their many achievements and good learning points for other cities around the world.

Ms Yap Lay Bee, Group Director of Architecture & Urban Design, Urban Redevelopment Authority Singapore, will take over as the new Prize Secretary.
