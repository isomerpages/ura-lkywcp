#### **Advisory note**

(*Updated 15 February 2021*)

Under the usual Prize cycle, the results of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize 2020 would be announced in March 2020. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global travel restrictions, the announcement will be postponed to a later date. 

[World Cities Summit (WCS)](https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg/) - where the Prize is a key highlight - will take on different formats this year to safeguard the safety and well-being of the participants. WCS 2021 will adopt a largely virtual format. From 21 to 23 June 2021, audience members will be able to dial in remotely to join our global thought leaders at the various WCS dialogues and plenaries. This is the first time that WCS will be adopting a virutal format since its inauguration in 2008, and the organisers look forward to this allowing a larger, and more international audience to join us remotely for WCS in June. 

WCS will return to the in-person format in 2022, alongside Singapore International Water Weekk (SIWW), and CleanEnviro Summit Singapore (CESG), subject to prevailing COVID-19 guidelines. The dates of the events will be announced later. Similarly, the Prize events held at WCS will also be pushed back to 2022.
