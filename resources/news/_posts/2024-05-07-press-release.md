##### Along with Mexico City, four other cities’ transformative efforts offer inspiration in galvanising communities to build stronger neighbourhoods, more restorative environments and enhance quality of lives 

#### **Press release**

**Singapore, 7 May 2024** – From building more resilient communities to restoring natural environments and improving quality of life, the 7th edition of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize continues to honour outstanding achievements and contributions to the creation of liveable, vibrant, and sustainable urban communities around the world. The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize is a biennial international award which has been jointly organised by Singapore’s Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Centre for Liveable Cities since 2010.

Mexico City, the capital of Mexico, has been awarded the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize 2024. Cape Town (South Africa), Melbourne (Australia), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Wellington (New Zealand) have also been selected as Special Mentions for their achievements and best practices in city management.

This year’s Prize Laureate, Mexico City stands out for its ability to address many complex urban challenges and achieve transformational progress within a relatively short time of five years. Through visionary leadership, the City introduced new programmes while rejuvenating existing ones, and brought about significant advancement in urban renewal and regeneration, environmental sustainability, transport and digital transformation to the benefit of its residents across all strata of society. Some of Mexico City’s key strategies are:

- **Building stronger and more resilient communities.** Mexico City implemented a range of inclusive social policies and programmes, such as free education for children and youth, and encouraging dignified ageing for the elderly. A standout initiative is PILARES (Puntos de Innovación, Libertad, Arte, Educación y Saberes’ or Points of Innovation, Freedom, Art, Education and Knowledge), which offers programmes for community bonding, youth rehabilitation, and continuous learning through 294 community centres throughout the city. These programmes also provide vital social safety nets and upskilling opportunities for marginalised communities, demonstrating the city’s commitment to uplifting the less privileged.
- **Creating more seamless commute.** Despite challenges posed by its complex urban landscape and fragmented transportation system, Mexico City has successfully integrated eight transit payment systems via a single transport card to enhance mobility for residents and transient populations. In addition to enhancing several transport infrastructure, it has also built the world’s longest cable car line to reduce time and cost of commuting, especially for low-income neighbourhoods.
- **Leveraging technology to improve lives.** Digital transformation efforts were introduced to promote digital inclusion and improve the provision of public service. Initiatives include the development of a centralised secure digital identity system, the “Llave” platform which enables residents to access the majority of the city’s services, from registering vehicles to retrieving birth certificates. In addition, the deployment of an extensive network of 31,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots has further ensured equal opportunities to access the Internet. 
- **Driving community-centric environmental efforts.** Re-vegetation efforts have been carried out to transform desolate land into parks and urban forests. Additionally, through community-based sustainable agricultural programmes, and upskilling programmes, residents are also trained in using the city’s rain harvesting system as an alternative water source installed for free in water-scarce areas. Such systems can support the majority of a household’s water needs for eight months in a year.

> ##### “Despite advancements in human science and technology, many basic human needs remain unmet in cities and social inequities continue to exist. Mexico City has demonstrated how its citizen-centric city programmes, supported by strong leadership and new digital initiatives to simplify and improve access to public services, can benefit its residents, regardless of their socio-economic status. Despite on-going challenges as a mega city, Mexico City provides an inspiring story, giving hope that it is possible to make impactful change if we are focused on a longer-term vision and boldly embrace urban innovation and inclusivity.”
