##### Part of the success of Chengdu’s Taikoo district in China lies in the juxtaposition of its sacred temples and commercial spaces which are more quotidian in contrast, says Christopher Law, Founder of architectural and placemaking firm, the Oval Partnership. He takes us through ancient temples and historic neighbourhoods to understand the power of placemaking in creating more memorable places and stronger communities.

#### **You have shared that building a compelling narrative and telling great stories are critical for placemaking. Why is this important?**

**Christopher:** Storytelling is often underestimated as a vehicle for placemaking efforts. It is a simple yet powerful way of communicating with and engaging people from different walks of life about a place. From the hawker, to the cleaner and even children, it is a universal medium that can make a place feel more relatable, endearing and come alive.

Through stories about places, people can find their own resonance in relating places to their personal experiences, stories and interests. A book that may be of interest to placemakers is “The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories (2004)” by the British journalist and author, Christopher Booker.  

While the book examines the basis of storytelling in literature and film, it reminds us on the real purpose of storytelling that connects to our inner most psyche. In telling stories about places, we should think about building the plot and creating protagonists. We have to remember that the key focus of places is not just about the buildings, it is always about people.   

#### **A key aspect of placemaking is in activating and curating great public spaces. What are some public space qualities we should pay closer attention to?**

**Christopher:** Every public space in our cities is different and they all play different roles. We need to plan and cater for a diverse range. A good public space should have essential qualities such as having good edges and a sense of enclosure. Many of the public spaces that we love tend to be engaging and vibrant.

But some public spaces can be impactful and profound without much embellishment or having a large crowd. You will notice that there are spaces in medieval monasteries or universities where they may have a lawn, courtyard or a quiet space in its central area.

Such an empty space can also create a strong sense of place. We can tell great stories about the meaning and spirit of places even through emptiness.

#### **New York City has almost 600 privately owned public spaces. How does the city government work with the private sector to create such an impressive number of public spaces?**

**Edith:**  We have been prioritising the creation of public spaces in private properties since the 1960s. Our initial focus was for public spaces to provide relief especially in denser areas. But over time, we saw that public spaces were important not just for mitigating density but can also help to make the city more welcoming, inviting and inclusive.   

In the beginning, the focus was just to provide a simple public space on the ground floor of the building so that people can walk through it. Over time, we refined our regulations to include finer elements such as indoor covered pedestrian spaces, seating and landscaping etc. We have also expanded our public space programme to ensure that provision of such spaces is not just in high-density areas.

We see the provision of public spaces in private properties as the ultimate public-private partnership. The government cannot pay for everything. So, what we did was we pioneered and wrote our regulations to mandate and encourage the private sector to deliver public amenities with the right incentives. For example, if developers provide a plaza or an open space in their properties’ ground floor, they will get six or 10 square feet (0.56 or 0.93 square metres) of extra floor area per one square foot of public space. For different kinds of public spaces provided like an arcade or a covered pedestrian space, the extra floor area will differ.  

In coming up with the right incentives for the private sector, we must find the right balance of incentives that are necessary and sufficient and are not just a giveaway to the private sector. The incentives have to be generous enough for the private sector to find it viable to provide public spaces in their properties and they too have to do their own analysis to assess if this can work for them.

#### **After so many years, how is the private sector embracing the provision of public spaces in private properties?**

**Edith:** When I started working in the city planning sector 25 years ago, there was more resistance from private property owners to provide public spaces even if they could get additional bonus floor area as they will still need to maintain the public space over time.  

It has taken decades to create an expansive array of public spaces throughout the city. Given the momentum that we have built over the years, there is now a strong desire in the private sector for their developments to be an integral part of the cityscape and public realm.  

It is exciting to now see developers wanting to deliver the next coolest and best public space. We also have private property owners come to us wanting to explore new public space ideas. People are realising that designing a building to be a part of the public realm will not only enhance the prestige of the building and the company, but it is also good for the city and people too. 

#### **As a planner, what have you learnt in encouraging and shaping public space provisions?**

**Edith:** What is most critical is that we need to continuously keep learning, calibrating and adjusting our regulations and amenities’ needs as we go along to ensure that we are delivering what people need today and in the future.  

It is also important to bear in mind that all public spaces are different. While there are similar traits in many of our public spaces, there are no two identical spaces. Every property is different. Every location is different. One space may need more circulation while another space may need more seating.  

As planners, when drafting the regulations and guidelines, we should not just cater for the lowest common denominator. We need to cater for and allow for outliers, for each public space to be unique and interesting.

#### **What is one public space in New York City that you find most memorable?**

**Edith:**  I continue to find the High Line very memorable. It is a great example of successful public-private partnership which remains today even in its maintenance and programming.

What many may not know is for the preservation of the High Line as a public amenity to be viable, we had to create a new transfer district spanning the entire length of the High Line. If your property is right next to the High Line, you can enjoy the transfer of development rights from the High Line. Property owners benefit from this in supporting their new construction projects. They get to build taller buildings along it. This ensures that there is lesser loss of development potential for their properties.  

As a result of investing in such a public amenity, within a few years of the High Line opening, billions of dollars were invested in real estate and the West Chelsea corridor, enhancing the entire neighbourhood. The High Line was a wonderful experiment and project for the city because it defied a lot of rules. A lot of people said an elevated public space won't work. Many said no one wants to be 30 feet above the ground and walking so close to apartments. You can look inside someone's apartment. It’s a bit strange, but it's quite wonderful. 

#### **Since New York City was awarded the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Laureate in 2012, what has been one major shift you have observed?**

**Edith:** One of the biggest shifts has been a stronger and deeper focus on enhancing our public realm. People are expecting more from the public realm and enhancements are also being delivered. Our public realm has improved significantly in the past decade.

The 9/11 event was also a pivotal moment where many felt that the city was taken away from them and destroyed in a way. It created enduring values and a fighting spirit where it motivates us to want to be part of rebuilding the city in coming out even stronger, making sure that we show that New York City is for everyone. This means investing heavily in our public realm. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
