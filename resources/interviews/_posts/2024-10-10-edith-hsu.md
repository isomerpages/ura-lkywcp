#### **You have shared that “every world class Central Business District (CBD) needs a world class public realm”. Why is it so important to invest heavily in enhancing our public realm?**

**Edith:**  The Central Business District in East Midtown has an incredible history with many banking, law, finance and real estate companies located here, including Fortune 500 companies. But over time, it started to lose its appeal not just to people coming to work here or are passing through but to corporations as well because it was too focused on offices. Beyond just coming to the offices to work, outside of these, it felt dead and quiet. There was not enough engaging street life and public spaces. It did not appeal to a wider diversity of the larger population beyond the CBD workers.

For world-class CBDs to function well, it is no longer enough to just cater for quality office buildings, investing heavily in the public realm has become critical. A city is ultimately for everyone. For New York City, where there is so much diversity and dynamism, the real action is on our sidewalks, our streets, our public spaces, parks and school playgrounds and even in public spaces within private properties. It is where we are meeting and interacting with people. 

#### **What does a good public space look like to you?**

**Edith:** A good public space is one that's inviting and cater for a diversity of people, not just for one generation or one gender. Whether you are using public spaces to rest, eat, read, or meet with friends and family, you should feel safe. The space should also be highly visible and accessible.

Over the years, we've been refining our regulations to enhance the design of public spaces, for them to have more porous openings and better sight lines and visibility, removing blocked areas so that you can see and enjoy the entire public space thoroughly.

#### **New York City has almost 600 privately owned public spaces. How does the city government work with the private sector to create such an impressive number of public spaces?**

**Edit:**  We have been prioritising the creation of public spaces in private properties since the 1960s. Our initial focus was for public spaces to provide relief especially in denser areas. But over time, we saw that public spaces were important not just for mitigating density but can also help to make the city more welcoming, inviting and inclusive.   

In the beginning, the focus was just to provide a simple public space on the ground floor of the building so that people can walk through it. Over time, we refined our regulations to include finer elements such as indoor covered pedestrian spaces, seating and landscaping etc. We have also expanded our public space programme to ensure that provision of such spaces is not just in high-density areas.

We see the provision of public spaces in private properties as the ultimate public-private partnership. The government cannot pay for everything. So, what we did was we pioneered and wrote our regulations to mandate and encourage the private sector to deliver public amenities with the right incentives. For example, if developers provide a plaza or an open space in their properties’ ground floor, they will get six or 10 square feet of extra floor area per one square foot of public space. For different kinds of public spaces provided like an arcade or a covered pedestrian space, the extra floor area will differ.  

In coming up with the right incentives for the private sector, we must find the right balance of incentives that are necessary and sufficient and are not just a giveaway to the private sector. The incentives have to be generous enough for the private sector to find it viable to provide public spaces in their properties and they too have to do their own analysis to assess if this can work for them.

#### **What could this mean for the future of top-tier 'Global Cities' such as London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and Singapore?**

**GC:** Global service sectors such as finance, law, consulting, media and information technology, which fuelled the rise of many of these cities in the 1990s and 2000s, are likely to be the most disrupted by the rise of flexible work. It will be important for these global cities to adapt and embrace new opportunities, and not lament the reduction in corporate jobs.

The pandemic is starting to play a 'sorting' role, separating the things that still need to be physically done in cities from those that do not. Nonetheless, there are exciting opportunities over the next few years for these cities, in:

- **Innovation:** Cities will continue to host innovation if they make the required changes. For example, by shifting towards innovation economy sectors such as the life sciences, regenerative medicine, and creative media production, where face-to-face proximity is often needed, and by developing innovation districts in places where demand from corporate jobs may be reduced, such as central business districts.
- **Experience:** To reinvent city centres affected by digitalisation and flexible work, cities will need to better curate and combine arts and culture, heritage, education, entertainment, dining, retail and public space into a mix of surprising and spontaneous attractions, using digital platforms to enhance their appeal.
- **Habitat:** Growing the resident population of cities is an opportunity to underpin urban amenities and retain vitality while also making efficient use of space and services. One option for many people is not just to work from home, but also to live nearer to work. Where buildings are convertible, we will see more of this. At the same time there are opportunities for smaller urban centres to develop co-working spaces and mixed-use districts that support work and leisure near home. With many people having been in 'lockdown' during the pandemic, these new patterns have yet to emerge. But they will.
- **Agility:** More spaces will perform multiple purposes. Some homes will become primary workplaces. But the larger trend will be for buildings in city centres to become more versatile. By day an office or shop, by night a bar or art gallery, or even a live performance venue.
- **Talent attraction:** Cities will increasingly compete to attract top talents and skilled workers, drawing them with special visas, incentives, and flexible live-and-work models available in a 'Blended City'.
- **Digital platforms in physical space:** A new logistics economy driven by digital commerce is emerging in cities. The growth of home delivery and its related mobility systems, the rise of data centres, fulfilment centres, dark kitchens and collection hubs, and their links to infrastructure webs, present new opportunities for cities to re-engineer space. One key issue is how to both enable these digitalised services, and also protect public goods such as safe pavements, clean air, and mobility flows. These new activities will need to address their own externalities and I expect to see new regulations requiring them to do so.

#### **How can cities in developing nations, which are growing rapidly and struggling to find the resources to adapt to the pandemic and other major disruptions such as climate change, cope in the long-term?**

**GC:** The pandemic has different implications for people living in cities in developing nations. COVID-19 has made the link between human health and housing conditions more visible, as people in the worst quality housing have been the most impacted. This is not a function of density per se, but about housing quality. Hence, in Latin America, Africa, India and ASEAN, I expect to see new initiatives emerge to tackle housing quality and inequality, as well as other urban systems like healthcare and water. These investments require fiscal power, not only from national governments, but through cities generating their resources and partnering with the private sector.

The pandemic will also accelerate the shift in population growth from very large cities to medium-sized cities. It is thus critical to prepare the latter for this through infrastructure investment and effective, sustainable planning. The largest cities in developing nations were often unprepared for rapid population growth. Sustainable urban development is easier to manage and achieve while population growth is occurring rather than afterwards, once patterns of informal settlement and transport have set in.

Post-pandemic, many developing nations will try to manage an overall system of cities, rather than focus narrowly on individual cities. In Indonesia, for example, we may see policies that simultaneously seek to regenerate Jakarta, create a new capital in East Kalimantan, increase the role and size of Bandung and Surabaya, and support the growth of another six to 10 cities. This approach will be essential to embrace sustainability and manage population movements.

One permanent challenge, which the pandemic has starkly revealed, is weak urban governance. COVID-19 has highlighted the need for well-run cities that are able to manage extreme situations effectively.

#### **Finally, in this time of crisis where global travel and the international conference sector remain severely curtailed, while some nations have turned inward-looking, a word please on the prospects for continued global collaboration.**

**GC:** At no time in the past 50 years has it been more important to share innovation and drive solutions that work across borders. The pandemic itself, the subsequent global public health and bio-security efforts, and the vaccine discoveries and rollouts, have proven that. Without global collaboration the pandemic would be very much worse. 

I do not believe in the idea of de-globalisation. Globalisation does need to be better managed to be more socially and environmentally responsible but working across borders is essential to address the planet’s imperatives. The individual countries that lead efforts to put their national interests first are often the ones that have no intention to address the major issues of our time such as climate change and global inequality. They seek to leave multilateral agreements and platforms in order to pursue regressive policies.

Despite severe constraints on reaching multilateral agreements on climate protection, inter-continental inequality, fair taxation, and technology dependency, it is essential to seek such global agreements. To abandon these efforts would be to abandon hope.

For cities, the appeal of international cooperation remains compelling. Every city is its own laboratory of urban life, creating fresh experiments that use different environments, methods, catalysts, and interventions to find solutions that work. Learning together by sharing knowledge and insights will enrich all cities’ efforts to become better places to live. Because successful cities are fundamental to creating a better planet, there is no real competition. We need all cities to succeed. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
