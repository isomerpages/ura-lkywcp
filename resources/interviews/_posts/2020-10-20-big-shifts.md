The still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives more extensively and pervasively than we had imagined at its start. Unlike the sporadic outbreaks of viruses over the past few decades with limited geographic spread, COVID-19's impacts are universal. Around the globe, it  has tremendously changed the way we work, learn, commute, play and socialise. As many experts have iterated, some of these changes are here to stay and life as we know it may never be the same as it was pre-pandemic. 

How can cities then adjust themselves to these long-term changes? What are the flaws and gaps that COVID-19 has exposed that need urgent addressing more than ever? And how can cities prepare themselves for long-term inclusive recovery in a world compounded by the ever-increasing urgency of climate change issues? The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Nominating Committee members gathered in a virtual roundtable to share their views on these, in the areas of work, social equity, and urban resilience.

#### **On the changing nature of work**

**Dr Cheong Koon Hean (CKH):** We have seen how everyone is excited about working from home, but we do not know what the proportion and shift is, and how permanent it is going to be. While some shift will happen, the question is how much of it will happen, and how it will impact real estate and the types of spaces that you need at work and at home. 

**Dr Chris Luebkeman (CL):** The question for me is about the ‘stickiness’ of change, i.e. what will stick and what will slide away. As humans, we tend to forget very quickly. When you look back at the consumption and activity curves in history, it seems that people were good at getting back at the curve. 

**Prof Wulf Daseking (WD):** COVID-19 is a wake-up call for all of us. During the 1918 Spanish Flu, some 65 million people died at the end of World War I. However, it was all forgotten afterwards. But this time it would not easily forgotten, as COVID-19 is compounded by the problem of global warming. 

**Lim Eng Hwee (LEH):** I understand that many companies are considering establishing a hub-and-spoke system, with satellite offices outside of the city centre. Although this may be a knee-jerk reaction, but once established it may stick for some time. 

We are also seeing opportunities arising from telecommuting. For example, it has changed the transport pattern tremendously. Transport capacity in many cities has still yet to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, and people also tend to travel during off-peak periods. This suggests an opportunity for planners to think more about mixed use planning. The question then is to what extent, and what the role of the downtown is if the trend of decentralisation continues. 

**CKH:** In Singapore, we already have some extent of decentralisation. We have neighbourhood areas outside the city centre where getting to day-to-day activities is convenient. The big question is to look at different poly-centres versus the downtown at a national level. What roles do they play and what are the appropriate sizes? 

**WD:** One can work from home in certain jobs such as insurance and bank offices, but not for others. In Asia, as the space at home per person is generally smaller than European counterparts, it would be challenging to implement long-term work-from-home arrangements. Remote working has also impacted the requirements of office spaces in the city more than ever. 

**Wong Mun Summ (WMS):** Work is changing. My office for example has adapted quite well, and there has not been a loss in productivity. However, people still want to get back together, but together as friends. I believe that it is the sociable quality in us that drive cities, rather than just work. We are looking at the transformation of workspaces to become less typical of what they were, and to become more creative and social ones. 

With everything on the cloud now, the workspace is a culture we need to keep, and we are thinking how to transform the office into a more fun and sociable one. This is the same for cities and other corporations. I believe a fundamental shift will come. Work will change but people as social creatures will not change. 

**CL:** With COVID-19 control measures, what a citizen is missing out is the inability to interact with others on a daily basis.

#### **On social equity & digital transformation**

**CL:** Switzerland is driven by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) – the lifeblood of the middle class. However, they are also the slowest to adapt to digital transformation. We have seen how COVID-19 accelerated the adaptation of digital transformation, and companies who do not latch on would risk disappearance. 

**Prof Marilyn Taylor (MT):** We have seen different stages over here in New York City and Philadelphia over the last six months. In the country, people are already living in a distance from each other. In the city however, people are living with constant fear and enormous caution. This quickly transferred to concern for essential workers and work-from-home conditions. 

Statistics show that where impacts are the worst are usually the minority groups and those who are less well-off. There is a huge devastation to small medium enterprises – the fabric and heart of those districts, with many unable to come back in same form. There are complex problems ahead, and a really hard time to come together to prioritise and help essential people first. 

Earlier on, there was a period of flight in New York for anyone with a country home. At some point, Manhattan has lost close to half its population for people who are able to do that. On the other hand, the real estate market was going crazy in small towns. This is a similar response to that after 9/11, with most trickled back in after one year or so. This is expressing the very inequality in our actions that we have been railing against in our professional lives and social interactions. 

**CL:** This is the same that happened in San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. Anyone who can afford to move to Lake Tahoe did. However, cities are going to come back. There are all sorts of fundamental human reasons for cities to exist that we will not simply abandon. Whether cities will become more polycentric or rethink its distribution of functionality or typology, at the end of the day, we come together not just to work, but also to interact or transact, whether is it a dinner, date or a deal.

It is important to differentiate those who sit to work and those who stand to work. The latter has been disproportionately impacted monetarily and existentially. The city is a portfolio of types of people conscious of the loss of those who has to stand to work.

#### **On climate change, urban resilience & inclusive recovery**

**CKH:** On the issue of climate change, how far do people link COVID-19 to climate change? 

**MT:** We are by nature optimists, focusing a lot on COVID-19 accelerated changes that are positive in the way we live, work and socialise, and run the places we love. But it is made so apparent that some things cannot be ignored, for example, the recent wildfires of San Francisco. There is a lot of work in front of us to do. 

**WD:** Global warming is the biggest event for all of mankind, especially for those in dangerous situations. COVID-19 is an alarm clock, and we need to stir the ship in another direction. In Germany, we are taking back some productions back to the country, arising from the lack of medicine during lockdown periods. I believe the city of short distances is coming back, but it is not easy to do that. 

**CL:** In Switzerland, there has been a massive awareness of ‘re-localisation’ – a discovery of what is available in your neighbourhood, state or country. 

**MT:** The rediscovery of local activities is a huge wonder, and there were no more bikes in New York City to buy. One of the reasons for the shift in opinions over last six months in the United States is that for the first time in a long time, you can go outside and see blue skies in Los Angeles. Why do we need to have a pandemic in order to understand that this is changeable and for not much longer?

**WD:** We would need to give more power to decentralise our cities. At the moment, cars are not selling, but there has been a huge increase in bicycles. There is a big chance now to give more power to the suburbs to become city of short distances. 

**LEH:** Urban resilience should be broader than just about the pandemic. It is also about how to sustain the city and resources over the long-term, and various changes due to climate change. 

**CL:** Cities need to think about inclusive recovery. COVID-19 exacerbated an understand of the inequalities of our cities: the gaps between the wealthy who can afford to ‘flee the ship’ and those who are stuck, and those who could order online and have their food delivered to their homes versus those who have to live with their pantries, etc. The ethnic challenges of inequalities are for many cities in the world. 

**WMS:** For ‘resilience’ in terms of climate change, there are two other terms that we can talk about – ‘self-sufficiency’ and ‘regenerative in cities’. When you talk about ‘self-sufficiency’, you immediately think about short distances. We do not have to travel as far, we do not have to buy things as far, and we can selectively make sure we can have our essentials at shorter distances. That is something almost all cities must have to a certain extent, including clean energy, food supply, and clean water. 

‘Self-sufficiency’ may be important to examine a little bit. This is equally important in how cities/countries can help the planet regenerate. Cities are consuming resources, and must find ways to regenerate the planet. We would need to see which are the cities that are taking the leadership to do that.

**LEH:** These two concepts can embrace many issues, and it is worth thinking along these lines, including decarbonisation. Another question to ask is what about the many cities/countries trying to move production capacity back to their home countries, and becoming more self-sufficient, but at the same time this may not be the most optimal outcome, whether be it from the resource point of view, or other perspectives. What is the right balance and direction?

**CL:** This is a good question. Until all the impacts are incorporated into the pricing of goods and service, it will be a constant challenge of a meaningful dialogue about what is the right mix of long, medium, and short distance. We can look for examples of cities who have taken steps in that direction. 

With COVID-19, it is concerning for us as global citizens how borders are quickly re-established, and armour went up quickly both literally and figuratively. On the other hand, in the scientific community, there is amazing sharing and response. For example, the DNA genome is brought to Geneva from Wuhan from very first DNA stream, and this allowed sequencing from day one. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
