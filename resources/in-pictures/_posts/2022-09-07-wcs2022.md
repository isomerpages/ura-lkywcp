#### **Starting the day with Alumni Breakfast** 

In the early morning on 1 August 2022, the Prize Laureates [Vienna](/vienna/) (represented by Mayor Dr Michael Ludwig) and [Bilbao](/bilbao/) (represented by City Councillor, Ms Oihane Agirregoitia) were hosted at the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Alumni Breakfast by Second Minister for National Development, Ms Indranee Rajah. The session is an exclusive ‘Laureate’s Club’, where the Prize Laureates share over breakfast what their cities have been doing since the award of the Prize. They were joined by the [Prize Council](/prize-council/) and [Nominating Committee](/nominating-committee/) members, [Prize Sponsor](/prize-sponsor/) Keppel Corporation and Organisers.

The meeting engaged in casual yet thought-provoking discussions on emerging issues ranging from age differences in the perception towards sustainability issues, challenges of cities in providing flexible work arrangements in a post-pandemic world, and how to encourage the shift towards sustainable transportation.
