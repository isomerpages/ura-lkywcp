##### From a post-war decline to a city on the rebound, Boston has remade itself through massive infrastructure projects, as well as smaller insertions to stimulate bigger changes. In this photo essay, we look at some examples of  Boston's urban transformation, big and small.

#### **Rebounding from decline** 

Boston is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the US, and the economic and cultural anchor of Greater Boston. One of the oldest cities in US, Boston has changed dramatically over the past 60 years. 

After the Second World War, Boston went into a decline and the city's population shrank by more than a third. The city and its region rebounded after 1980 with the residents' tenacity and world-class hospitals and universities as leverage, reinventing into a knowledge economy. 

At the same time, the city tackled blight by undertaking massive infrastructure projects and developing new public facilities to spur urban revitalisation.

#### **Rejuvenating waterfronts** 

The [Boston Harborwalk](https://www.bostonharbornow.org/what-we-do/explore/harborwalk/) stretching from Dorchester to East Boston is an important part of the city's waterfront revitalisation programme. The public walkway connects neighbourhoods to the harbour, linking recreational, cultural and historical attractions, as well as access to public transit. The city set zoning regulations to ensure that the waterfront remains publicly accessible to all. 

[Martin's Park](https://martinsparkboston.org) in South Boston incorporates flood resilient techniques, as well as inclusive play structures allowing children of all abilities to experience discovery and exploration. The park is a natural respite in the dense urban environment, and a meaningful way to honour the youngest victim of the 2012 Boston Marathon bombings while also addressing climate issues.

#### **Stimulating changes** 

In [401 Park](https://www.samuelsre.com/properties/401-park/) in the Fenway area, the Developer Samuels & Associates worked with the authorities over five years to rezone and up-zone the land parcels. The historic Landmark Centre was renovated and expanded to include a public space and a ['Time-Out Market'](https://www.timeoutmarket.com/boston/) food hall. The latter became a magnet in the local community and helped spur interest in its surrounding area. 

The [Bruce C. Bolling Municipal Building](https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/domain/1590) is an important civic function (headquarters of the Boston Public Schools) injected into the Dudley Square neighbourhood to uplift its 'rough' image, and provide a stimulus for private developments and businesses. Part of the prime street level space is set aside for business or non-profit use, and the [Roxbury Innovation Center](https://roxburyinnovationcenter.org) - a new business incubator.
