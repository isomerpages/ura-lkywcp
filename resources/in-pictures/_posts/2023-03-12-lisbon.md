One of the oldest cities in the world, Lisbon is the capital and largest city of Portugal and predates other contemporary European capitals by centuries. Lisbon experienced recent turbulent times of transition, including the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the aftermath of the 1974 Carnation Revolution, which introduced 500,000 new residents to the city as well as social tensions and infrastructure issues.  

In the ensuing decades, Lisbon has responded by implementing creative urban projects to get more done with less, encouraging a fresh influx of energy and rediscovery. By implementing strategic projects, it is readying itself to meet present and future challenges.

#### **Lisbon riverfront, redefined** 

The Targus River divides Lisbon from its neighbouring towns in the south, forming a 19-kilometre riverside along the city's southern boundary. The ‘General Intervention Plan for the Lisbon Riverside Region’ launched in 2008 is a result of an agreement between the federal government and the Port of Lisbon (Porto de Lisboa). 

The plan saw strategic projects that redefined the riverfront, such as the Lisbon Cruise Terminal, the Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology (MAAT), Comercio Square (Praça do Comérico/Terreiro do Paço), and Campo das Cebolas. Weekend road closures along the riverfront establish continuous car-free areas to prioritise pedestrians.

#### **Public squares, redeveloped** 

With 17 interventions already completed, the ‘A Square in Each Neighbourhood’ programme seeks to develop 30 squares in neighbourhoods throughout the city. In the first five years since the programme's inception, there has been an increase in public participation, which shows a greater interest in and ownership of neighbourhood public areas. 

According to a CERIS study, the number of cyclists and pedestrians in the Central Axis (Exio Central) area increased by 6 to 7 and 2.5 times respectively, between 2016 and 2017. By choosing the best urban interventions for the biggest paradigm shift, Lisbon has shown that it is on the right path to success.

#### **Historic quarter, transformed** 

The Mouraria quarter is transformed from a historically and stigmatised area of prostitution and drugs to a vibrant and diverse district today that draws in new visitors. By celebrating and enhancing the character of the district’s multi-ethnic communities, Mouraria is regenerated as ‘cities within cities, and given a facelift including restoration of historic buildings and cobblestone pavements, and installation of artworks to commemorate the birth of Fado in the neighbourhood. In 2009, the city established the TODOS Caminhada de Culturas Festival to celebrate the area's cultural richness.
