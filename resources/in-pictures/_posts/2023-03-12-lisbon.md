One of the oldest cities in the world, Lisbon is the capital and largest city of Portugal and predates other contemporary European capitals by centuries. Lisbon experienced recent turbulent times of transition, including the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755[^1] and the aftermath of the 1974 Carnation Revolution[^2], which introduced 500,000 new residents to the city as well as social tensions and infrastructure issues.  

In the ensuing decades, Lisbon has responded by implementing creative urban projects to get more done with less, encouraging a fresh influx of energy and rediscovery. By implementing strategic projects, it is readying itself to meet present and future challenges.

#### **Lisbon riverfront, redefined** 

The Lisbon riverfront holds significant importance as it not only serves as a natural boundary for the city but also boasts key developments and car-free areas that have transformed the area into a vibrant and popular destination for locals and tourists alike.

In 2008, the federal government and the Port of Lisbon launched the 'General Intervention Plan for the Lisbon Riverside Region' which involved strategic projects to redefine the 19-kilometre riverside area along the Targus River, including the establishment of car-free areas to prioritise pedestrians.

#### **Public squares, redeveloped** 

Lisbon is actively revitalising its neighbourhoods through the 'A Square in Each Neighbourhood' programme, which aims to develop 30 public squares throughout the city. The programme has garnered greater public participation and ownership of neighborhood public spaces over the first five years since its launch. 

As a result, the number of cyclists and pedestrians in the Central Axis area increased significantly, indicating the success of Lisbon's approach in selecting the most effective urban interventions for bringing about a positive change.

#### **Historic quarter, transformed** 

Lisbon transformed the historically stigmatised Mouraria quarter into a vibrant and diverse district by celebrating and enhancing the multi-ethnic character of the area's migrant communities. This involved restoring historic buildings, cobblestone pavements, and installing artworks to commemorate the birth of Fado in the neighbourhood. The TODOS Caminhada de Culturas Festival was established in 2009 to celebrate the cultural richness of Mouraria.
