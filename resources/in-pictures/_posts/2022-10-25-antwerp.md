#### **Small – acupunctural interventions** 

In the 90s and 2000s, several neighbourhoods close to Antwerp's city centre suffered from neglect and population loss. The once vibrant and folksy neighbourhoods such as Sailors Quarters lost their appeal to quieter ones outside Antwerp's ring road. With the moving of many industrial uses to outside of the city, it left behind a series of abandoned industrial buildings often unsanitary and dangerous. 

[AG VESPA](https://www.agvespa.be) is an autonomous public developer that aims to identify and redevelop such vacant/dilapidated plots into affordable housing units. It consciously searches for locations that are too small, dirty or complex to attract private developers. A key aspect of AG VESPA's development strategy is to engage young architects to test ideas and boost their careers. 

Small scale projects with high architectural quality serve as urban acupuncture that can further catalyse rejuvenation and privte initiatives. The proceeds from the sales of the rejuvanted buildings are then reinvested into new projects in a form of a rolling fund. The initiative triggers the upgrading of 'difficult' neighbourhoods and has the power to transform entire districts.

#### **Medium – derelict areas** 

While Vienna already preserves over 50 percent of its land areas as green spaces, it is also increasing greenery at the building level. The '50 Grüne Hauser' project is a green façade system that aims to develop cost-effective, easy-to-apply modules on existing buildings to help regulate building temperatures and mitigate urban heat island effects. 

These modules meet the city's requirements in tandem with a complementary tool to simplify the application process that would otherwise involve up to nine official entities. Through a one-stop shop system that facilitates collective approval rather than separate reviews, the application period is reduced from a year to a couple of months, lowering the barriers significantly for building owners.

#### **Large – River Scheldt and the ring road** 

Vienna has continually invested in public transport infrastructure and actively promoted cycling and walking. Today, to get around the city, 28 percent of inhabitants walk, 7 percent cycle, 38 percent use public transport, and 27 percent use motorised transport. 

Taking public transport in Vienna today is a largely hassle-free affair, especially for its gantry-less metro system. While the proportion of motorised individual traffic has decreased over time, the city is relentless in its push towards sustainable transportation with a series of measures such as the promotion of electric vehicles and park and ride infrastructure. 

A small but highly notable initiative is the introduction of a very affordable annual public transportation ticket at 365 Euros, or 1 Euro per day, to further encourage citizens to give up their cars. It is a success as the number of such passes issued in 2018 amounted to over 822,000, which means that more people own a pass than a car.
