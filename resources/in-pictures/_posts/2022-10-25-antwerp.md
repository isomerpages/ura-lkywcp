description: Vienna focuses on small initiatives, such as engaging its residents to co-create community spaces, enabling its building owners to adopt quick greening modules on façades, and encouraging private car owners to make the switch to public transportation, to achieve big impacts. Find out how in this photo essay.

##### Instead of a fast-paced urban development, Antwerp deliberately chose a slow considered approach that incorporates ground views and flexibility for changes along the way. In this photo essay, we examine how Antwerp take things in small, medium and large ways.

#### **Small – acupunctural interventions** 

In the 90s and 2000s, several neighbourhoods close to Antwerp's city centre suffered from neglect and population loss. The once vibrant and folksy neighbourhoods such as Sailors Quarters lost their appeal to quieter ones outside Antwerp's ring road. With the moving of many industrial uses to outside of the city, it left behind a series of abandoned industrial buildings often unsanitary and dangerous. 

[AG VESPA](https://www.agvespa.be) is an autonomous public developer that aims to identify and redevelop such vacant/dilapidated plots into affordable housing units. It consciously searches for locations that are too small, dirty or complex to attract private developers. A key aspect of AG VESPA's development strategy is to engage young architects to test ideas and boost their careers. 

Small scale projects with high architectural quality serve as urban acupuncture that can further catalyse rejuvenation and privte initiatives. The proceeds from the sales of the rejuvanted buildings are then reinvested into new projects in a form of a rolling fund. The initiative triggers the upgrading of 'difficult' neighbourhoods and has the power to transform entire districts.

#### **Medium – derelict areas** 

There was a lack of an overall urban planning strategy for the long term in Antwerp. At the end of the 1980s, with pressure from civil society and experts, the city acknowledged that more long-term solutions need to developed, especially in the neglected port areas such as het Eilandje (the Islet), Scheldekaaien (Scheldt Quays), and adjacent port railway infrastructure such as Spoor Noord anbd Nieuw Zuid (New South).

Tapping on the European Regional Development Fund and funding from Belgian and Flemish governments, Antwerp was able to implement the first urban renewal projects in areas such as the Central Station area, Schipperskwartier (Sailor's Quarter) and Spoor Noord. These efforts cumulated in the 2006 Strategic Spatial Plan Antwerp that introduced 'renovatio urbis' (or slow urbanism) – renewal of the city through interventions in public space.

#### **Large – the ring road** 

Vienna has continually invested in public transport infrastructure and actively promoted cycling and walking. Today, to get around the city, 28 percent of inhabitants walk, 7 percent cycle, 38 percent use public transport, and 27 percent use motorised transport. 

Taking public transport in Vienna today is a largely hassle-free affair, especially for its gantry-less metro system. While the proportion of motorised individual traffic has decreased over time, the city is relentless in its push towards sustainable transportation with a series of measures such as the promotion of electric vehicles and park and ride infrastructure. 

A small but highly notable initiative is the introduction of a very affordable annual public transportation ticket at 365 Euros, or 1 Euro per day, to further encourage citizens to give up their cars. It is a success as the number of such passes issued in 2018 amounted to over 822,000, which means that more people own a pass than a car.
