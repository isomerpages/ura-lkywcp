#### **Seoullo 7017 – from major driveway to sky garden**

Seoullo 7017 is a conversion of the Seoul Station Overpass into a 1 km elevated public pedestrian passage, with plants, commercial and performance spaces, and public facilities along the way.

The overpass was built in 1970 as a major driveway to connect western and central Seoul. After more than 40 years of heavy use, it was closed in 2015 due to safety concerns. While some had called for the overpass to be demolished, the city was inspired by New York’s High Line, and decided to convert it into a park instead.

Seoullo 7017 is a signifier of the city’s paradigm shift from car-oriented transportation to people-centric spaces. It is a well-used public space in central Seoul today.

#### **Makercity Sewoon – from ageing superblocks to synergy between old and new**

The Makercity Sewoon project is a rehabilitation of seven commercial and residential superblocks in central Seoul built in the 1970s into a hub for technology, manufacturing and business start-ups.

The existing shop-owners are relocated within the same complex, while new uses are introduced, re-injecting vibrancy in the dilapidated area. Start-ups can now use business incubation spaces in the complex, called “Makers’ Cubes”, for their creative development activities, such as the design and fine-tuning of drones and smart medical devices.

Elevated bridges that had been torn down were rebuilt to reconnect the complex’s seven blocks, and new studios and retail units were added along pedestrian walkways.

#### **Mapo Culture Depot – from disused oil tanks to an arts and culture hub**

The Mapo Culture Depot is the repurposing of the disused oil tanks at the former oil depot at Maebong into a spacious park and cultural venue with galleries and performance spaces, a multipurpose pavilion, an outdoor amphitheatre, and a café.

The oil storage facility was abandoned since the early 2000s due to the construction of the Seoul World Cup Stadium nearby in preparation for the city’s co-hosting of the 2002 World Cup. By repurposing the abandoned facility and returning the space to the people, the city demonstrates creativity in conserving its industrial heritage and putting them to new uses.
