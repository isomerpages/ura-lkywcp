#### **Seoul: 2018 Prize Laureate** 

Seoul was awarded the 2018 Prize for its transformation from a bureaucratic, top-down city into an inclusive, socially stable and innovative city. With rapid urbanisation, Seoul had faced challenges like environmental degradation, and increasing resistance from a citizenry largely left out of planning decisions. The Seoul Plan 2030 was a turning point, with its bold move to make citizen participation the norm in urban planning. Seoul built trust with its citizens, assuring them that through engagement, they could shape the future of the city.

> "A beautiful city with enriching cultural heritage and dynamic character, Seoul is where urban vitality and greenery coexist. As part of growthoriented measures in the past, Seoul had concentrated on expanding urban infrastructure, a period that was known as the “Miracle on the Han River”. However, some of these measures induced urban problems. Seoul sought answers from its past experience and implemented urban renewal projects focusing on recovery and resilience: such as Cheonggyecheon Stream, Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP), and Seoullo 7017.
<br><br> Now, we face the challenges of COVID-19, which restrain every aspect of our lives. The pandemic drives Seoul to take robust and coordinated actions to improve the city for all. Once again, focusing on existing and new plans, the Seoul Metropolitan Government is striving to make the city more sustainable and resilient, both during and beyond this COVID-19 pandemic." 

-- Mayor of Seoul, Oh Se-hoon

#### **HafenCity: more city in the city** 

HafenCity is a redevelopment of a former inner-city brownfield site that radically transformed the underused 157 hectares of harbour and industrial space into a dynamic mixed-use district, while complementing the adjacent Speicherstadt district. It is a demonstration of the city’s focus on densification in the built-up area of the city and utilising inner city space more efficiently rather than building on peripheral areas, following the strategy of “More City in the City”. 

HafenCity is a plan-led urban development and one of its major objectives is the urban mix of housing, workplaces and recreational use on a small scale. It deviates from the old model of dedicated office districts, in that there are no single use buildings and users are ‘forced to meet their neighbours’, leading to cohesion and integration. Like all major urban development projects in Hamburg, new projects in HafenCity consist of three equal parts: one third social housing, one third condominiums, and one third privately funded rental housing. This ensures the right conditions for a good social mix and diverse urban neighbourhoods.

#### **A living laboratory of innovative urban solutions** 

After the great storm surge of 1962 that claimed the lives of hundreds of people in Wilhelmsburg in the south of the city – the largest river island in Europe, many residents left the area. In subsequent years this area became a “problem area”. Following a Conference and a policy paper in the 2000s, Hamburg developed the International Building Exhibition (IBA) as a powerful tool to develop and boost the growth of the booming metropolis. 

IBA implemented some 70 innovative projects in the area, many of which are experimental and/or demonstrative in nature, seeking to address the many urban issues that Hamburg and many other cities face today. Similar to that of HafenCity, IBA adopts an integrated holistic approach which is broadly decoupled economically from political budgeting processes.

#### **Inclusive planning processes**

Over the last decade, Hamburg has made it a point to involve citizens in urban planning on a level that by far exceeds the statutory provisions stipulated by building and planning law. People have the opportunity to participate in the very early stages of planning – the results often lay the groundwork for the actual planning – through various channels including but not limited to workshops, face-to-face interviews, online participation, surveys or town hall meetings. 

An example of such an inclusive planning process is Hamburger Deckel – the decking over for parts of the Autobahn A7, which currently divides densely populated neighbourhoods of the city, to provide noise protection. The conversations and discussions with citizens enabled the administration to convince gardeners holding allotment gardens within the implementation site to give up their existing plots and be compensated with new ones to be built on top of the new decks. 

When completed, the decks will provide several additional benefits besides protection from traffic noise – enable land along autobahn to be developed; safe crossings for school children; and pedestrian/cycling shortcuts reconnecting previously divided parks.
