description: Vienna focuses on small initiatives, such as engaging its residents to co-create community spaces, enabling its building owners to adopt quick greening modules on façades, and encouraging private car owners to make the switch to public transportation, to achieve big impacts. Find out how in this photo essay.

##### Instead of a fast-paced urban development, Antwerp deliberately chose a considered approach that incorporates ground views and flexibility for changes along the way. In this photo essay, we examine how Antwerp take things slow in small, medium and large ways.

#### **Small interventions for affordable housing** 

Boston is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the US, and the economic and cultural anchor of Greater Boston. One of the oldest cities in US, Boston has changed dramatically over the past 60 years. 

After the Second World War, Boston went into a decline and the city's population shrank by more than a third. The city and its region rebounded after 1980 with the residents' tenacity and world-class hospitals and universities as leverage, reinventing into a knowledge economy. 

At the same time, the city tackled blight by undertaking massive infrastructure projects and developing new public facilities to spur urban revitalisation.

#### **Medium-sized urban voids, rejuvenated** 

The Boston Harborwalk stretching from Dorchester to East Boston is an important part of the city's waterfront revitalisation programme. The public walkway connects neighbourhoods to the harbour, linking recreational, cultural and historical attractions, as well as access to public transit. The city set zoning regulations to ensure that the waterfront remains publicly accessible to all. 

Martin's Park in South Boston incorporates flood resilient techniques, as well as inclusive play structures allowing children of all abilities to experience discovery and exploration. The park is a natural respite in the dense urban environment, and a meaningful way to honour the youngest victim of the 2012 Boston Marathon bombings while also addressing climate issues.

#### **Large-scale reconfiguration of the city** 

Antwerp's ring road is a major infrastructure that divides the city into its inner and outer parts. It also disconnects residents in the former from greenery. For two decades, plans to close the ring road loop have reached a deadlock due to severe opposition over the disamenities of increased traffic, air and noise pollution. 

A group of local citizens from various backgrounds gathered to propose the idea of covering the ring road as a sustainable solution for improved mobility, living conditions and increased greenery. What was a confrontational situation was thus turned into a long-term collaboration that could benefit from citizen involvement and knowledge. 

To do things 'slow', the city appointed an independent curator backed by a design team to oversee the project and engage with some 4,000 citizens. To do things 'small', the city divided the massive project into six smaller sections and called for international design teams with a multidisciplanry mix to work on each section.
