description: Vienna focuses on small initiatives, such as engaging its residents to co-create community spaces, enabling its building owners to adopt quick greening modules on façades, and encouraging private car owners to make the switch to public transportation, to achieve big impacts. Find out how in this photo essay.

##### Instead of a fast-paced urban development, Antwerp deliberately chose a considered approach that incorporates ground views and flexibility for changes along the way. In this photo essay, we examine how Antwerp take things slow in small, medium and large ways.

#### **Small interventions for affordable housing** 

In the 1990s and 2000s, several neighbourhoods close to Antwerp's city centre suffered from neglect and population loss. The once vibrant and folksy neighbourhoods such as Sailors Quarters lost their appeal to quieter ones outside of Antwerp's ring road. With the moving of many industrial uses to outside of the city, it left behind a series of abandoned industrial buildings often unsanitary and dangerous. 

[AG VESPA](https://www.agvespa.be) is an autonomous public developer that aims to identify and redevelop such vacant/dilapidated plots into affordable housing units. It consciously searches for locations that are too small, dirty or complex to attract private developers. A key aspect of AG VESPA's development strategy is to engage young architects to test ideas and boost their careers. 

Small-scale projects with high architectural quality serve as urban acupuncture that can further catalyse rejuvenation and private initiatives. The proceeds from the sales of the rejuvenated buildings are then reinvested into new projects in a form of a rolling fund. The initiative triggers the upgrading of 'difficult' neighbourhoods and has the power to transform entire districts.

#### **Medium-sized urban voids, rejuvenated** 

There was a lack of an overall urban planning strategy for the long term in Antwerp. At the end of the 1980s, with pressure from civil society and experts, the city acknowledged that more long-term solutions need to developed, especially in the neglected port areas such as het Eilandje (the Islet), Scheldekaaien (Scheldt Quays), and adjacent port railway infrastructure such as Spoor Noord and Nieuw Zuid (New South).

Tapping on the European Regional Development Fund and funding from Belgian and Flemish governments, Antwerp was able to implement the first urban renewal projects in areas such as the Central Station area, Schipperskwartier (Sailor's Quarter) and Spoor Noord. These efforts cumulated in the [2006 Strategic Spatial Plan Antwerp](https://www.antwerpen.be/docs/Stad/Stadsvernieuwing/9746949_urbandevelopment_English.pdf) that introduced 'renovatio urbis' (or slow urbanism) – renewal of the city through interventions in public space.

#### **Large-scale reconfiguration of the city** 

Antwerp's ring road is a major infrastructure that divides the city into its inner and outer parts. It also disconnects residents in the former from greenery. For two decades, plans to close the ring road loop have reached a deadlock due to severe opposition over the disamenities of increased traffic, air and noise pollution. 

A group of local citizens from various backgrounds gathered to propose the idea of covering the ring road as a sustainable solution for improved mobility, living conditions and increased greenery. What was a confrontational situation was thus turned into a long-term collaboration that could benefit from citizen involvement and knowledge. 

To do things 'slow', the city appointed an independent curator backed by a design team to oversee the project and engage with some 4,000 citizens. To do things 'small', the city divided the massive project into six smaller sections and called for international design teams with a multidisciplanry mix to work on each section.
