description: Vienna focuses on small initiatives, such as engaging its residents to co-create community spaces, enabling its building owners to adopt quick greening modules on façades, and encouraging private car owners to make the switch to public transportation, to achieve big impacts. Find out how in this photo essay.

##### Instead of a fast-paced urban development, Antwerp deliberately chose a considered approach that incorporates ground views and flexibility for changes along the way. In this photo essay, we examine how Antwerp take things slow in small, medium and large ways.

#### **Small interventions for affordable housing** 

Boston is the capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the US, and the economic and cultural anchor of Greater Boston. One of the oldest cities in US, Boston has changed dramatically over the past 60 years. 

After the Second World War, Boston went into a decline and the city's population shrank by more than a third. The city and its region rebounded after 1980 with the residents' tenacity and world-class hospitals and universities as leverage, reinventing into a knowledge economy. 

At the same time, the city tackled blight by undertaking massive infrastructure projects and developing new public facilities to spur urban revitalisation.

#### **Medium-sized urban voids, rejuvenated** 

There was a lack of an overall urban planning strategy for the long term in Antwerp. At the end of the 1980s, with pressure from civil society and experts, the city acknowledged that more long-term solutions need to developed, especially in the neglected port areas such as het Eilandje (the Islet), Scheldekaaien (Scheldt Quays), and adjacent port railway infrastructure such as Spoor Noord and Nieuw Zuid (New South).

Tapping on the European Regional Development Fund and funding from Belgian and Flemish governments, Antwerp was able to implement the first urban renewal projects in areas such as the Central Station area, Schipperskwartier (Sailor's Quarter) and Spoor Noord. These efforts cumulated in the [2006 Strategic Spatial Plan Antwerp](https://www.antwerpen.be/docs/Stad/Stadsvernieuwing/9746949_urbandevelopment_English.pdf) that introduced 'renovatio urbis' (or slow urbanism) – renewal of the city through interventions in public space.

#### **Large-scale reconfiguration of the city** 

Antwerp's ring road is a major infrastructure that divides the city into its inner and outer parts. It also disconnects residents in the former from greenery. For two decades, plans to close the ring road loop have reached a deadlock due to severe opposition over the disamenities of increased traffic, air and noise pollution. 

A group of local citizens from various backgrounds gathered to propose the idea of covering the ring road as a sustainable solution for improved mobility, living conditions and increased greenery. What was a confrontational situation was thus turned into a long-term collaboration that could benefit from citizen involvement and knowledge. 

To do things 'slow', the city appointed an independent curator backed by a design team to oversee the project and engage with some 4,000 citizens. To do things 'small', the city divided the massive project into six smaller sections and called for international design teams with a multidisciplanry mix to work on each section.
