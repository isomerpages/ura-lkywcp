#### **Co-creating communal anchors** 

Borne from the belief that public spaces should be used in diverse ways that increase the quality of people's stay, the Grätzloase programme is an initiative that provides support for temporary public space activiation in Vienna. The programme is carried out by the NGO 'Local Agenda 21 in Vienna' with funding support from the city of Vienna. 

With advice from Local Agenda 21, citizens can shape public spaces such as transforming parking lanes into parklets that serve as community nodes. Complete with greenery, these parklets become communal anchors for street festivals or meals among neighbours. As such, citizens become city makers who can exercise creativity and shape their surroundings. 

Despite the modest scale of parklets, the programme's impact is substantial as they are easily replicable and do not require big budgets. Projects are also highly effective engagement levers that contribute to making the city greener, and fostering stronger community bonds.

#### **HafenCity: more city in the city** 

While Vienna already preserves over 50 percent of its land areas as green spaces, it is also increasing greenery at the building level. The '50 Grüne Hauser' project is a green façade system that aims to develop cost-effective, easy-to-apply modules on existing buildings to help regulate building temperatures and mitigate urban heat island effects.

#### **A living laboratory of innovative urban solutions** 

After the great storm surge of 1962 that claimed the lives of hundreds of people in Wilhelmsburg in the south of the city – the largest river island in Europe, many residents left the area. In subsequent years this area became a 'problem area'. Following a Conference and a policy paper in the 2000s, Hamburg developed the International Building Exhibition (IBA) as a powerful tool to develop and boost the growth of the booming metropolis. 

IBA implemented some 70 innovative projects in the area, many of which are experimental and/or demonstrative in nature, seeking to address the many urban issues that Hamburg and many other cities face today. Similar to that of HafenCity, IBA adopts an integrated holistic approach which is broadly decoupled economically from political budgeting processes.

#### **Inclusive planning processes**

Over the last decade, Hamburg has made it a point to involve citizens in urban planning on a level that by far exceeds the statutory provisions stipulated by building and planning law. People have the opportunity to participate in the very early stages of planning – the results often lay the groundwork for the actual planning – through various channels including but not limited to workshops, face-to-face interviews, online participation, surveys or town hall meetings. 

An example of such an inclusive planning process is Hamburger Deckel – the decking over for parts of the Autobahn A7, which currently divides densely populated neighbourhoods of the city, to provide noise protection. The conversations and discussions with citizens enabled the administration to convince gardeners holding allotment gardens within the implementation site to give up their existing plots and be compensated with new ones to be built on top of the new decks. 

When completed, the decks will provide several additional benefits besides protection from traffic noise – enable land along autobahn to be developed; safe crossings for school children; and pedestrian/cycling shortcuts reconnecting previously divided parks.
