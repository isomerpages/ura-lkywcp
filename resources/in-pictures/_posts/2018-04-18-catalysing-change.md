description: Seoul used to be a city where urban development is carried out under the mandate of the central government in a rapid fashion, resulting in a low quality of life and an unhappy populace. In the 2000s, Seoul started to implement a series of catalytic projects that helped to reshape the city and align the citizens’ aspirations with its vision. In this photo essay, we look at some of these projects that propelled a new era in Seoul’s city development.

#### **Seoul – before and after**

Seoul is the capital and largest metropolis of South Korea. With a population of 10.2 million in 2016, it is a megacity and the world’s 16th largest city. Seoul experienced a tremendous growth spurt between the 1960s and 2000, with its population increasing from 1.7 million in 1960 to 10.5 million in 2000 (or 6.2 times increase). At the same time, its car population has increased from 8,000 to 2.5 million (or 312.5 times increase). Such a rapid growth over a relatively short period had a great impact on the spatial transformation of the city, at the expense of quality of life.

#### **Cheonggyecheon – before and after**

Following the instatement of local autonomy in the mid-1990s, the city focused on a series of innovative urban regeneration projects that brought about benefits for the entire city. The removal of the ageing Cheonggyecheon highway to restore the stream underneath was the starting point in the city’s efforts in urban regeneration and engaging stakeholders through conflict management strategies in order to realise a common vision.

#### **Cheonggyecheon – a green haven in the city**

More than 10 years after its completion, Cheonggyecheon is today a green haven in the middle of the city, and a respite from the hustle and bustle of its surroundings, which has in turn benefited from the restoration project. The success of Cheonggyecheon catalysed the demolition of a number of elevated highways in Seoul, induced public demand for the demolition of others and resistance to building new ones, and helped pave the way for less resistance in the city’s subsequent urban redevelopment projects.

#### **Dongdaemun Area Regeneration: before and after**

The Dongdaemun area was a manufacturing hub in the 1960s and 70s, and an urban mess up to as recent as 2005, with makeshift street vendors occupying the Dongdaemun Stadium and its surrounding streets. In a bid to shift Seoul’s focus from manufacturing to a design city, the Dongdaemun area was overhauled with the iconic Dongdaemun Design Plaza designed by Zaha Hadid Architects at its helm. Seoul’s officials further refined its conflict management strategies that helped find win-win solutions for both the city and the affected street vendors and merchants.

#### **Yonsei-ro: before and after**

The Yonsei-ro Transit Mall is a pilot project to promote a pedestrian-oriented environment, and part of the city’s overall vision to shift its focus of transport planning from private transport to public transport, and including pedestrians and cyclists. The project is intended to manage transportation demand by restricting private car access and reducing traffic speeds, enhance public transit experience by enhancing the timeliness, speed, and frequency of public transit, and improve the pedestrian environment by providing pedestrian-friendly urban design such as widened sidewalks, bus-waiting areas, more shelters, and removing of road curbs. On weekends, the Yonsei-ro Transit Mall is converted into a pedestrian-only zone for various activities.

### **Yonsei-ro Transit Mall**

What used to be a narrow street congested with buses, cars, and people, the Yonsei-ro Transit Mall has shifted its focus towards public transport, cyclist and pedestrians, and is today one of the busiest tourist attractions in Seoul with increased street vibrancy.
