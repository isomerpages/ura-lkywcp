#### **In brief**

- Environmental degradation as a result of rapid industrialisation during the Soviet period and lack of proper infrastructure led to a general lack of motivation in the people of Kazan to adopt healthy lifestyles and sporting activities. 
- This is further compounded by youth crimes, falling birth rates and health issues which affected the quality of life since the 1970s. 
- Since 2006, the new leadership team under Mayor Ilsur Metshin turned this around by strategically developing urban infrastructure with a focus on sports and health. 
- Since then, Kazan has been named the ‘Sports Capital of Russia’ and hosted several key sporting events, such as the 2013 Summer Universiade, 2014 World Fencing Championships, the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, and is one of the host cities for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

#### **Key issues before the project**

###### ![Degraded environment before the transformation](/images/features/2021/bulak-river-before.jpg/)**Degraded environment before the transformation** © City of Kazan

- A low level of interest for sports and healthy lifestyles due to inadequate sporting facilities and environmental degradation, leading to health issues and increased crimes, such as drug abuse.
- In 2006, only 13.1 percent of Kazan’s population (or approximately one in every seven citizens) participated in sports.
- In that same year, the city’s mortality rate exceeded the birth rate for the first time.
- Kazan was a city that was known for its youth crimes and unhealthy populace, an undesirable image that the city wanted to shed. At the same time, the low quality of life resulted in an exodus of local talents to other cities or abroad.

- The city formed its Environmental Council in 2012 with leading experts responsible for the city’s landscaping, strengthening the green structure and improving the conditions of recreational, coastal and aquatic areas. 
- The city also established boards of trustees for 25 parks and public gardens from enterprises and organisations that took patronage. 
- In 2016, Kazan adopted the ‘Kazan 2030 Strategy’ for social and economic development. The Strategy emphasises on healthy lifestyles, while increasing the share of population engaged in physical activities and sports up to 50 percent and life expectancy to 76 years by 2030.

#### **Impacts**

###### ![Impacts of the case study](/images/features/2021/kazan-impacts.png/)

- Kazan successfully shed its undesirable image of the past and saw a reduction of mortality rate. For example, deaths associated with heart attacks decreased from 86.4 to 58.2 per 100,000 (or 32.6% decrease) from 2006-2014, with a decrease in the number of smokers, drug addicts and crimes.
- Currently, approximately 40 percent or every one in three citizens engage in sports activities regularly, an increase of 26.9 percent from 2006. 
- The hosting of 2013 Universiade helped develop urban spaces and provide urban amenities, with the facilities well-utilised post-event. The medical centre constructed for the Universiade Village now functions as a students’ polyclinic for about 70,000 people from 27 education institutions. 
- As of 2017, there are 2,027 sports facilities including 15 stadiums, 12 roofed ice arenas, 54 swimming pools, 378 sports halls and 942 planar sports venues.
