#### **In brief**

- Vienna embarked on creating a flood relief channel (New Danube) in 1969 to mitigate potentially devastating floods, especially those exacerbated by climate change.
- The new 21.1km-long, 210m-wide channel runs alongside the existing Danube, with its excavated soil forming a recreational island in between – Danube Island.
- The Danube remains as a main navigation channel, while the New Danube is activated via weirs to absorb excess water volumes during flood events.
- Otherwise, the New Danube and Danube Island are used for leisure purposes for most of the year.

#### **Key issues before the project**

- The Danube is key to Vienna’s urban development as a flood would be detrimental to the city.
- In the 1870s, the city widened and straightened the existing Danube and created a 450m-wide inundation zone and a flood protection dam, catering to a maximum flood water volume of 11,700m<sup>3</sup>/s.
- The 1954 flood highlighted the need to further increase the protection levels to handle larger flood volumes up to 14,000m<sup>3</sup>/s, statistically expected to occur every 3,000 to 5,000 years.

#### **Leadership and governance**

- The city called for the architectural and landscape design of New Danube and Danube Island via an open competition.
- A team made up of hydraulic engineers, architects and landscape planners worked closely during the planning and implementation phase.
- The processes ensure that the project not only serves its primary function of flood protection, but provides free-of-charge leisure options, water and energy production, and nature and biodiversity protection.

#### **Creativity and innovation**

- Danube Island is raised at least 1m above projected flood levels, offering a 390ha flood-free surface.
- New Danube is designed as a large usable waterbody for water sports, with inlets and basins for docking rowing boats and sailboats.
- Danube Island is designed as a large park with its ends as forested zones and meadows, and integrated old river branches with residues of riparian forest and ancient trees.
- A facility built to absorb the wastewater from the Eastern bank helped prevent the contamination of New Danube.
- A controlled introduction of water to the Lobau floodplains nature reserve helped prevent further depletion of water volumes due to reduction of groundwater levels..

#### **Impacts**

###### ![Impacts of the case study](/images/features/2023/impacts-vienna-parklets.png/)

- The farsighted planning allowed the city to continue growing on the banks of the Danube and offer a high quality of life.
- The flood protection system helps the city avert major damages during flood events, such as during a record torrential downpour in July 2021.
- New Danube and Danube Island are popular leisure destinations today, with frequent large-scale cultural and sporting events, such as Danube Island Festival.
- The project with its careful landscaping has seen an increased in biodiversity.
- The Freudenau Power Plant completed in 1998 provides 1.037 billion kWh of electricity per year, sufficient to supply over 280,000 households or half of Vienna’s private households.

#### **Replicable ideas**

- Taking the long-term view, a city can turn potential threats into opportunities.
- Vienna’s forward-looking plans allowed the city to continue to grow safely and sustainably, even before climate change entered the mainstream vocabulary.
- Creative and integrated approaches allowed the city to look beyond a mere infrastructural solution, but developing multiple uses, especially those that would benefit the people directly. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
