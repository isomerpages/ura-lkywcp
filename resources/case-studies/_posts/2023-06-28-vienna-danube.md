#### **In brief**

- Vienna embarked on creating a flood relief channel (New Danube) in 1969 to mitigate potentially devastating floods, especially those exacerbated by climate change.
- The new 21.1km-long, 210m-wide channel runs alongside the existing Danube, with its excavated soil forming a recreational island in between – Danube Island.
- The Danube remains as a main navigation channel, while the New Danube is activated via weirs to absorb excess water volumes during flood events.
- Otherwise, the New Danube and Danube Island are used for leisure purposes for most of the year.

#### **Key issues before the project**

- The Danube is key to Vienna’s urban development as a flood would be detrimental to the city.
- In the 1870s, the city widened and straightened the existing Danube and created a 450m-wide inundation zone and a flood protection dam, catering to a maximum flood water volume of 11,700m<sup>3</sup>/s.
- The 1954 flood highlighted the need to further increase the protection levels to handle larger flood volumes up to 14,000m<sup>3</sup>/s, statistically expected to occur every 3,000 to 5,000 years.

#### **Leadership and governance**

- The city called for the architectural and landscape design of New Danube and Danube Island via an open competition.
- A team made up of hydraulic engineers, architects and landscape planners worked closely during the planning and implementation phase.
- The processes ensure that the project not only serves its primary function of flood protection, but provides free-of-charge leisure options, water and energy production, and nature and biodiversity protection.

#### **Creativity and innovation**

- The number of uniquely designed parklets in parking lanes have increased annually since the launch of the programme. The efforts of the first three years of the programme are documented in the book ['Parklets // Street Furniture Vienna'](https://www.startnext.com/parklets).
- The parklets helped to create easily accessible public spaces where everyone could take part in creative and fun activities such as playing table tennis with a round table and self-made rackets and bread-making on the streets. 
Novel activities such as dining on the street were replicated in various parts throughout the city.

#### **Impacts**

###### ![Impacts of the case study](/images/features/2023/impacts-vienna-parklets.png/)

- The enthusiasm of residents brought about a broad variety of ideas, with nearly all the selected projects realised. 
- New neighbourly relationships were forged and strengthened as seen through the replication of ‘dining on the street’. 
- 44 parklets were realised in 2018, and 70 in 2019, demonstrating the popularity of the programme in turning parking lanes into meeting nodes. 
- Private areas were opened for public use, for example a supermarket’s parking lot was used as a playground for children.
- The initiative generated numerous positive press reports that created wider awareness.

#### **Replicable ideas**

- Financial support and advice from the city are a good lever to promote citizen engagement and ground-up initiatives, creating a collaborative atmosphere between citizens and district councils. 
- A variety of public spaces were used for the programme, including parking lanes, squares, sidewalks, traffic islands, stairs, parks, and roads. Cities can look for opportunities to turn drab utilitarian spaces into fun and vibrant shared spaces at low cost. **<font color="#967942">O</font>**
