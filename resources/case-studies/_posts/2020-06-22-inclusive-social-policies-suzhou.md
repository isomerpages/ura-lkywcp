- These inclusionary policies are regarded as one of the significant achievements of Suzhou.

#### **Key issues faced before the implementation of the project**

- Surge of migrant workers to the city seeking jobs as a result of rapid economic growth, with a lack of protection for these  workers. 
- Disparity in quality of life between rural and urban areas in terms of housing, education and employment opportunities.
- Inadequate public services and social security for migrant workers.

#### **Leadership and governance**

- The Municipal Government acts as the key legislation agency in implementing plans and projects for the city, and coordinates sub-departments, such as district-level governments, Urban and Rural Planning Committee, Municipal Planning Bureau, etc. 
- Community residents and relevant enterprises provide feedback for specific urban transformation plans to align results with their requirements. 
- Suzhou Municipal People’s Congress examines and approves these transformation plans, and formalises them as laws and regulations after their approval, to ensure the sustainability of the transformation.

#### **Creativity and innovation**

- A ‘Residence Permit’ allows non-native residents to access citizen-equivalent benefits in nine areas including education, healthcare and employment. 
- The city built public rental housing, manages private rental housing, and introduced housing fund policy among other measures to improve the living conditions of non-native residents. 
- The Municipal Government introduced policies to include housing of non-native residents with its housing security policy. Some 855,000 non-native employees (or 48% of total employees) enjoy same housing funds as native employees. 
- New citizens receive free job introduction and employment training to ensure fair employment, and non-native employees enjoy same insurance policies as their native counterparts.
- Equal and efficient public services enable all employees to enjoy all kinds of employment services within the community, with 99 new ‘Citizens Comprehensive Service Centres’ established for non-native residents’ exclusive use.
- Local regulations and working guidelines ensure the fair and equal treatment of the children of migrant workers in the city, allowing them to receive compulsory education.
