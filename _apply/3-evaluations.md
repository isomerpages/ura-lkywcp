- How can cities increase their resiliency to bolster against future shocks? 
- What can cities do to bridge the gaps of social equity?
- What immedia measures and long-term plans do cities need to take to adapt to and limit the adverse effects of climate change?

The Prize Laureate and Special Mentions will share their outstanding urban initiatives at the Prize Lecture and Prize Forum respectively, key highlights of [World Cities Summit](https://www.worldcitiessummit.com.sg) in Singapore.
