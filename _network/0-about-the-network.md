###### ![City Network](/images/features/2024/city-network.jpg/)**City Network for LKY World City Prize**

The **City Network for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize (LKYWCP Network)** was launched on 3 June 2024 at the World Cities Summit 2024, with the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) serving as co-Secretariats.

The Network will facilitate global knowledge exchange on building liveable and sustainable cities and contribute towards improving the lives of citizens globally. It is envisioned as a community of practice for urban leaders and practitioners to collaborate on projects and provide a platform for global dialogue on urban issues. It will bring cities together to collectively address urban challenges through partnerships and joint projects.

Founding Members of the Network comprise representatives from the seven Laureate cities of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize since its inauguration in 2010. These cities are represented by government officials, planning professionals, as well as nominated knowledge organisations. The 20 Special Mention cities that have been recognised by the Prize over the years have also been invited to join the Network.

#### **Founding members**

Founding Members of the Network are Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Laureates:

- Bilbao (2010) and Bilbao Metropoli 30 (BM30)
- New York City (2012) and Regional Planning Association (RPA)
- Suzhou (2014) and Suzhou Spatial Planning Think Tank Platform
- Medellín (2016) and Ruta N
- Seoul (2018) and Seoul Institute (SI)
- Vienna (2020) and Urban Innovation Vienna (UIV)
- Mexico City (2024) and México ¿cómo vamos?

#### **Network activities**

Members will participate in various forms of knowledge sharing on best practices and capability building initiatives to identify solutions for urban challenges. Collaboration efforts may take the form of multilateral projects such as joint research and pilots on sustainable urban rejuvenation as well as joint publications featuring case studies on models and approaches to quality affordable housing. The outcomes of such projects will be shared at future editions of the World Cities Summit for global benefit.

The Network was formally inaugurated at the World Cities Summit, with the first Knowledge Forum kickstarting the Network’s collaborative efforts. The Knowledge Forum brought together representatives from the seven Laureate founding members of the Network to reflect on the urban challenges that their respective cities have tackled over the last decade and to take on a future-oriented perspective to discuss the ones that will impact their future. The panellists shared forward-looking plans and unique solutions to future-proof their city in the face of climate change, changing demographics, housing affordability and ageing infrastructure.

A second session for the Network at the World Cities Summit was the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Network Convening Session which assembled representatives from the various Prize cities. This platform aims to share and exchange insights on their continued progress and recent urban initiatives, to foster knowledge-sharing and innovation among cities, with the aim of amplifying the impact of their efforts across the world from a practitioner’s perspective.

We look forward to an exciting journey ahead for more multi-city collaborations and knowledge exchanges through the Network!
