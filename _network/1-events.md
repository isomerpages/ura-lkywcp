This session kickstarts the formalisation of the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Network – an initiative to foster deeper city-to-city partnerships to create and exchange knowledge on sustainable and liveable cities. The Knowledge Forum will convene representative knowledge organisations from the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Laureate cities, founding members of the Network, to reflect on the urban challenges that their respective cities have tackled over the last decade and the ones that will impact their future. The presentations and ensuing panel discussion will highlight best practices to address these challenges, and explore how cities can collaborate to find solutions for their urban future.

Panelists include representatives from LKYWCP Network founding member cities of Bilbao, Medellín, Mexico City, New York City, Seoul, Suzhou, and Vienna. The panel featured an opening address by Prof. Cheong Koon Hean, Chair, LKYWCP Nominating Committee and Chair, Advisory Panel for the Centre for Liveable Cities; and was moderated by Dr Lam Khee Poh, Provost’s Chair Professor of Architecture and the Built Environment, National University of Singapore.
