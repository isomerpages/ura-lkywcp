**The City Network for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize** (LKYWCP Network) is a platform for urban leaders and practitioners to connect and engage in creating and exchanging knowledge on building liveable and sustainable cities.

Through various initiatives, member cities can explore topics of mutual interest with the intention of:
- sharing best-in-class practices
- collaborating to find solutions for common urban challenges of the future
- supporting each other’s knowledge efforts
- leveraging each other’s knowledge networks

This may take the form of joint projects, engaging in dialogue as a community of practice, and various capability development opportunities.

The LKYWCP Network was launched at World Cities Summit 2024 with an announcement by Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development at the Opening Plenary on 3 June 2024.

#### **Practical solutions**

To facilitate the sharing of best practices in urban solutions that are easily replicable across cities, the Prize will place an emphasis on practical and cost effective solutions and ideas, for the benefit of cities around the world. Through this Prize, Singapore hopes to promote exemplary thought-leadership and exchange of ideas among cities, so as to spur further innovation in the area of sustainable urban development.

The Prize Laureate will be presented with an award certificate, a gold medallion and a cash prize of Singapore Dollars $300,000, sponsored by [Keppel Ltd](https://www.keppel.com/).

#### **A fitting tribute**

The Prize is named after [Singapore’s first Prime Minister](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Past-Prime-Ministers/Mr-LEE-Kuan-Yew). Mr Lee was instrumental in developing Singapore into a distinctive, clean and green garden city in a short span of a few decades. Under his leadership, the adoption of strategic land use, transport and environmental policies and programmes have helped Singapore to develop into a liveable city with a high quality living environment, in tandem with rapid economic growth.

The Prize is co-organised by the [Urban Redevelopment Authority Singapore](https://www.ura.gov.sg/) (URA) and the Centre for Liveable Cities. The Prize Secretariat sits within URA.
