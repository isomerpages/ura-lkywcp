**The City Network for the Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize** (LKYWCP Network) is a platform for urban leaders and practitioners to connect and engage in creating and exchanging knowledge on building liveable and sustainable cities.

Through various initiatives, member cities can explore topics of mutual interest with the intention of:
- sharing best-in-class practices
- collaborating to find solutions for common urban challenges of the future
- supporting each other’s knowledge efforts
- leveraging each other’s knowledge networks

This may take the form of joint projects, engaging in dialogue as a community of practice, and various capability development opportunities.

The LKYWCP Network was launched at World Cities Summit 2024 with an announcement by Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development at the Opening Plenary on 3 June 2024.

The Network was jointly found by the first 7 LKYWCP Laureates and is also open to the Prize's Special Mentions and future awardees. To enrich the engagements, the Network also brings together various stakeholders from each city: mayors, city hall, planning departments, and knowledge organisations.
