The Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) was jointly established by the Ministry of National Development and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in June 2008. The CLC is a policy-oriented Centre that seeks to bring together Singapore's expertise on sustainable urban development in the areas of good governance, urban planning, effective resource management, quality living environment, affordable housing and sustainable transport solutions from across government, industry and academia. The Centre will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices among cities in the region and globally.

The CLCâ€™s vision is to be a centre of global excellence that brings together the best ideas and practices that support efforts in building liveable cities that are dynamic, vibrant, cohesive and sustainable. CLC seeks to achieve this vision through its mission which is to harness developmental experiences across the public, private and people sectors from Singapore and the rest of the world in order to position Singapore as an innovative thought-centre on high-density urban living and sustainable development.
